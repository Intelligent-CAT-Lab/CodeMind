he variable str is initialized with the input. Then it finds the index of the first decimal point in the string.
Then it finds the value of the digit to the right of the decimal point and stores it in variable d.
Then it finds the value of the digit to the left of the decimal point and stores it in variable i.
If the value of variable i is 9, then it prints the string GOTO ‚ñÅ Vasilisa. and returns.
If the value of variable d is greater than or equal to 5, then it prints the string obtained by replacing the digits to the left of the decimal point with the value of variable i + 1.
Otherwise, it prints the string obtained by replacing the digits to the left of the decimal point with the value of variable i.
