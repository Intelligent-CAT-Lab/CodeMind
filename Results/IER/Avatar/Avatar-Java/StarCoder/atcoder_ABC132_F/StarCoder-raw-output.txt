he variable n and variable k are initialized with 10 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable r.
Inside the while loop, it adds the length of the current interger r to the list len.
Then it checks if the current interger l is greater than the current interger r. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the length of the list len and stores it in variable q.
Then it initializes an array dp with length k * (q + 1).
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to q to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable dp[j].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[j] by adding the length of the current interger j to the previous value of dp[j - 1].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to q to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp[i * (q + 1) + j].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i * (q + 1) + j] by adding the previous value of dp[i * (q + 1) + j - 1] and the product of the previous value of dp[(i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1] and the length of the current interger j.
Then it prints the final value of dp[k * (q + 1) - 1] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
