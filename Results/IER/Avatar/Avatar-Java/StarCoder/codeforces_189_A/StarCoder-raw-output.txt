e variable n is initialized with 29.
The variable a is initialized with 27, 18 and 2.
The variable max is initialized with 0.
The variable d is initialized with -500.
The variable d is filled with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 29 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than or equal to 0 and if the value of d[i - a[j]] is not -1. If it is, it calculates the maximum value of d[i] and d[i - a[j]] + 1 and stores it in d[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable d[n] as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class a {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int max = 0;
        int d[] = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(d, -500);
        d[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i - a[j] >= 0 && d[i - a[j]]!= -1) {
                    d[i] = Math.max(d[i], d[i - a[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(d[n]);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the
