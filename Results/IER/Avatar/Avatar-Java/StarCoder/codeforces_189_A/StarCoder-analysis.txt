e variable n is initialized with 29.
The variable a is initialized with 27, 18 and 2.
The variable max is initialized with 0.
The variable d is initialized with -500.
The variable d is filled with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 29 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than or equal to 0 and if the value of d[i - a[j]] is not -1. If it is, it calculates the maximum value of d[i] and d[i - a[j]] + 1 and stores it in d[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable d[n] as output, which is 3.
