he variable x is initialized with 0.
It checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = new java.util.Scanner(System.in).nextInt();
        if (x == 0) {
            System.out.println("1");
        } else {
            System.out.println("0");
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
