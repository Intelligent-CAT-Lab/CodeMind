he variable anser is initialized with 0.
The variable count is initialized with 5 elements, each of which is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger x to the corresponding element of variable count.
Then it checks if the corresponding element of variable count is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable anser to i. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable anser as output, which is 4.
