he variable anser is initialized with 0.
The variable count is initialized with 5 elements, each of which is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger x to the corresponding element of variable count.
Then it checks if the corresponding element of variable count is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable anser to i. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable anser as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i]);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with n elements, each of which is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger x to the corresponding element of variable arr.
Then it sorts the elements of variable arr in ascending order.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i
