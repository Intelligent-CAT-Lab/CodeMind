he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the current character c is 0 or 1. If it is 0, it increments variable ans1 by 1. If it is 1, it increments variable ans2 by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the minimum value of variable ans1 and variable ans2 as output, which is 0.
