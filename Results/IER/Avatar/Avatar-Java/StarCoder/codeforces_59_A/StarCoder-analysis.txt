he variable word is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string word. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ch.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character ch is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, it increments the value of variable uppercase by 1. If it is lowercase, it increments the value of variable lowercase by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable uppercase is greater than the value of variable lowercase. If it is, it prints the uppercase version of the string word.
If the value of variable lowercase is greater than the value of variable uppercase, it prints the lowercase version of the string word.
If the value of variable uppercase is equal to the value of variable lowercase, it prints the lowercase version of the string word.
