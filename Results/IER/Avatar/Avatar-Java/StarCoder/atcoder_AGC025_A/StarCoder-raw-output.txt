e variable n is initialized with 9.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String n = in.nextLine();

        for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
            if (n.charAt(i)!= '0') {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < n.length(); j++) {
                    sum += n.charAt(j) - '0';
                }
                System.out.println(sum);
                return;
            }
        }

        if (n.charAt(0) == '1') {
            System.out.println(10);
            return;
        }

        System.out.println(n.charAt(0));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
