he variable s1 is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string s1 is '1'. If it is, it checks if variable c0 is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements variable c0 by 1 and increments variable ans by 1.
If variable c0 is not greater than 0, it checks if variable c1 is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements variable c1 by 1 and increments variable ans by 1.
If variable c1 is not greater than 0, it increments variable c0 by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
