he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 2, 3, 6 and 6 respectively according to the input.
The value of x3 is calculated by adding the difference of y1 and y2 to x2. The value of y3 is calculated by subtracting the difference of x1 and x2 from y2.
The value of x4 is calculated by subtracting the difference of y2 and y1 from x1. The value of y4 is calculated by adding the difference of x2 and x1 to y1.
After the calculations, it prints the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 as output, which is 8 3 2 5.
<<<Output>>>
8 ▁ 3 ▁ 2 ▁ 5
