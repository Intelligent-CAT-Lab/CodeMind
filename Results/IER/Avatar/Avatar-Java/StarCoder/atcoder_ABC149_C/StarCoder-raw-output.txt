he variable X is initialized with 9552 according to the input.
The variable prime is initialized with the value of variable X.
The variable mid is initialized with the value of variable prime divided by 2.
The variable flag is initialized with false.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable flag is false.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the value of variable mid.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable prime is divisible by i. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
If the value of variable flag is still false after the for loop, it breaks out of the for loop and enters the next iteration of the while loop.
If the value of variable flag is true after the for loop, it breaks out of the while loop and enters the next iteration of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable prime as output, which is 9553.
<<<Output>>>
9553

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int prime = X;
        int mid = prime / 2;
        boolean flag = false;
        
        while (true) {
            for (int i = 2; i <= mid; ++i) {
                if (prime % i == 0) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (!flag) {
                break;
            } else {
                flag = false;
            }
            
            prime++;
        }
        
        System.out.println(prime);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9552
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 9552 according to the input.
The variable prime is initialized with the value of variable X.
The variable mid is initialized with the value of variable prime divided
