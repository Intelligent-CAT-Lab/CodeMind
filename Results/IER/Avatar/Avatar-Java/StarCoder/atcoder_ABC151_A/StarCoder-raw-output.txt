The variable c is initialized with the first character of the string s.
The value of variable c is incremented by 1.
The value of variable c is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        char c = s.charAt(0);
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```c
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
