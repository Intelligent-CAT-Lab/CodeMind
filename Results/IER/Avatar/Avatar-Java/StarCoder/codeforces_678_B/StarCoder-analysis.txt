variable y is initialized with 2096 according to the input.
The function check_leap is called with variable y as the argument.
The function check_leap returns true if the year y is a leap year, otherwise it returns false.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable mod is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from y + 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the days of the current interger i by checking if the current interger i is a leap year or not.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is divisible by 7. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is a leap year or not. If it is, it checks if the variable leap is true or not. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output and returns. Otherwise, it continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 2096.
