he variable n is initialized with 9995083.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9995083 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9995083
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
