he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 20 and 19 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static long n, k, m, l, a, b, c;
    static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        a = sc.nextInt();
        b = sc.nextInt();
        n = sc.nextInt();
        k = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i * a <= n; i++) {
            k += b;
        }
        System.out.println(k);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 20 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
