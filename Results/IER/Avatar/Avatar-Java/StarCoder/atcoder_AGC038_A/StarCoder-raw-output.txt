he variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 1000, 1000, 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by using the bitwise XOR operator.
The condition is met when j is less than a XOR i is less than b.
After the second for loop finishes, it appends the value of variable x to the string builder sb.
After the first for loop finishes, it appends the string builder sb to the output.
<<<Output>>>
