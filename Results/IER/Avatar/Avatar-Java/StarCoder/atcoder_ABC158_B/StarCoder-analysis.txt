he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 501719768609305159, 370614275896614890 and 131105492712690269 respectively according to the input.
The variable base is initialized with the value of N divided by the sum of A and B.
The variable mod is initialized with the value of N modulo the sum of A and B.
If the value of mod is greater than or equal to A, then the value of mod is set to A.
The final value of variable base multiplied by A plus the value of mod is printed as output.
