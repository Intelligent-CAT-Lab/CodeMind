he variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable kuti is less than or equal to variable b.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable kuti by subtracting 1 from it and adding variable a to it.
Then it increments the value of variable tap by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable tap as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int kuti = 1;
        int tap = 0;
        
        while (kuti < b) {
            kuti = kuti - 1 + a;
            tap++;
        }
        
        System.out.println(tap);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
