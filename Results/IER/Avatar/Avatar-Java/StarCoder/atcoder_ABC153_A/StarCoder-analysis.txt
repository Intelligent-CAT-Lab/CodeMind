he variable monsterHP is initialized with 10000 and variable servalATK is initialized with 1.
The value of variable mod is calculated by taking the remainder of the division of variable monsterHP by variable servalATK.
The value of variable ans is calculated by taking the quotient of the division of variable monsterHP by variable servalATK.
If the value of variable mod is greater than 0, then variable ans is incremented by 1.
After the calculations, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10000.
