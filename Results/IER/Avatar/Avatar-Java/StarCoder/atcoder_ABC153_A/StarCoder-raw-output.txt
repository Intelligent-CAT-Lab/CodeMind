he variable monsterHP is initialized with 10000 and variable servalATK is initialized with 1.
The value of variable mod is calculated by taking the remainder of the division of variable monsterHP by variable servalATK.
The value of variable ans is calculated by taking the quotient of the division of variable monsterHP by variable servalATK.
If the value of variable mod is greater than 0, then variable ans is incremented by 1.
After the calculations, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int k = scan.nextInt();
        scan.close();

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % k == 0) {
                ans++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 and variable k is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable k. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
