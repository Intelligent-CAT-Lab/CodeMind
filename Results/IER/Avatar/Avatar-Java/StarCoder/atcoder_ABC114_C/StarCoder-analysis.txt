variable N is initialized with 333333357.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to the length of the input string S minus 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
Then it calls the function f with the arguments 3 * (int) Math.pow(10, S.length() - 1), S.length() - 2.
The function f calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
Then it calls the function f with the arguments 5 * (int) Math.pow(10, S.length() - 1), S.length() - 2.
The function f calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
Then it calls the function f with the arguments 7 * (int) Math.pow(10, S.length() - 1), S.length() - 2.
The function f calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000000.
