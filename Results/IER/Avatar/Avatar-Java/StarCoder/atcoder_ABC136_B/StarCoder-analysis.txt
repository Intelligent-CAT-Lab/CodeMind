he variable N is initialized with 99999.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from N to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the while loop, it divides the current interger temp by 10 to get the number of digits of the current interger.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the number of digits of the current interger i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is the last digit of the current interger N. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is odd or even.
If it is odd, it adds the difference between the current interger N and the power of 10 of the current interger i minus 1 plus 1 to variable ans.
If it is even, it adds the difference between the power of 10 of the current interger i and the power of 10 of the current interger i minus 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 24999.
