he variable a and variable b are initialized with 80 and 970 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to variable b.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable res.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 100.
