he variable a and variable b are initialized with 80 and 970 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to variable b.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable res.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int res = a;
        
        while (a >= b) {
            res += (a / b);
            a = (a / b) + (a % b);
        }
        
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```80 970
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
