he variable n is initialized with 100 and variable count is initialized with 10000.
The variable a is initialized with (n + 1) / 2 and variable b is initialized with n / 2.
The variable max is initialized with a * a + b * b.
If count > max, it prints "NO" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "YES" and enters a for loop to print the island.
Inside the for loop, it checks if (i + j) % 2 == 0 and if count > 0. If it is true, it prints "L" and decrements count by 1.
Otherwise, it prints "S".
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sb as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int count = scan.nextInt();
        printIsland(n, count);
    }

    public static void printIsland(int n, int count) {
        int a = (n + 1) / 2;
        int b = n / 2;
        int max = a * a + b * b;
        if (count > max) {
            System.out.println("NO");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("YES");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i + j) % 2 == 0 && count > 0) {
                    sb.append('L');
                    count--;
                } else {
                    sb.append('S');
                }
            }
            sb.append("\n");
        }
        System.out.println(sb);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 10000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your
