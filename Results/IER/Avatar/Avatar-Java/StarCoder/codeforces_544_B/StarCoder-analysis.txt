he variable n is initialized with 100 and variable count is initialized with 10000.
The variable a is initialized with (n + 1) / 2 and variable b is initialized with n / 2.
The variable max is initialized with a * a + b * b.
If count > max, it prints "NO" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "YES" and enters a for loop to print the island.
Inside the for loop, it checks if (i + j) % 2 == 0 and if count > 0. If it is true, it prints "L" and decrements count by 1.
Otherwise, it prints "S".
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sb as output.
