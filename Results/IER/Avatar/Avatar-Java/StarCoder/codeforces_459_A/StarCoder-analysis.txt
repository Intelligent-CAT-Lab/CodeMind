he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 4, 0, 0 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x1 is equal to x2. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of y1 minus y2 and assigns it to variable dif. Then it prints the values of x1 plus dif, y1, x1 plus dif and y2.
If x1 is not equal to x2, it checks if y1 is equal to y2. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of x1 minus x2 and assigns it to variable dif. Then it prints the values of x1, y1 plus dif, x2, y2 plus dif.
If x1 is not equal to x2 and y1 is not equal to y2, it checks if the absolute value of x1 minus x2 is equal to the absolute value of y1 minus y2. If it is, it prints the values of x1, y2, x2 and y1.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1.
