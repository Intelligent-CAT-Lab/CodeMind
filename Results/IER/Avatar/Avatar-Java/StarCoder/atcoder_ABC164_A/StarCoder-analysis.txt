he variable Sheep is initialized with 1 and variable Wolve is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to -1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it reads a line from the input and adds it to the ArrayList scList.
Then it splits the first line of the input into an array of strings and stores it in the variable numlist.
Then it converts the first and second elements of the array numlist to integers and stores them in the variables Sheep and Wolve.
Then it checks if the value of variable Wolve is greater than or equal to the value of variable Sheep. If it is, it prints "unsafe" as output.
Otherwise, it prints "safe" as output.
