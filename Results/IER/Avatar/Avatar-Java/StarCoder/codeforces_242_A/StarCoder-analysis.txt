he variable x, variable y, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than or equal to the current interger j. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the second for loop and goes to the next iteration of the first for loop.
After the second for loop finishes, it adds the current interger i and j to the list res.
After the first for loop finishes, it print the size of the list res as output, which is 2.
