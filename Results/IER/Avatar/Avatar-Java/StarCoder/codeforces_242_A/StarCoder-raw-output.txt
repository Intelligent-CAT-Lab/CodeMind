he variable x, variable y, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than or equal to the current interger j. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the second for loop and goes to the next iteration of the first for loop.
After the second for loop finishes, it adds the current interger i and j to the list res.
After the first for loop finishes, it print the size of the list res as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
        }
        pw.println(dp[n - 1]);
        pw.close();
    }

    static void debug(Object... obj) {
        System.err.println(Arrays.deepToString(obj));
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the
