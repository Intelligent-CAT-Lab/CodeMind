e variable n is initialized with 24 and variable k is initialized with 7440 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable k is less than or equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable req by dividing variable i by variable n.
Then it checks if variable k is greater than or equal to variable req. If it is, it subtracts variable req from variable k.
If it is not, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable k as output, which is 12.
