The `+` operator then concatenates these two parts in reverse order, effectively rotating the list to the right by `m` places.\n\nFor example, if you call `rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)`, it will return `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>", "model_name": "MagicCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPPNoTest", "nl": "Write a function to rotate a given list by specified number of items to the right direction. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-right-rotate-list-n/", "input_data": "rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],3)", "expected_output": "[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]", "assertion": "assert rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],3)==[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"}

The idea is to maintain a list of subsets where each subset is a list of numbers that are divisible by each other. For each number in the input list, we check if it can be added to any of the existing subsets. If it can, we add it to that subset. If it can't, we create a new subset with that number. Finally, we return the size of the largest subset.\n\n```python\ndef largest_subset(a):\n    subsets = []\n    for num in a:\n        for subset in subsets:\n            if all(num % subset_num == 0 for subset_num in subset):\n                subset.append(num)\n                break\n        else:\n            subsets.append([num])\n    return max(len(subset) for subset in subsets)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each number in the input list and checking if it can be added to any of the existing subsets. If it can, it is added to that subset. If it can't, a new subset is created with that number. Finally, the function returns the size of the largest subset, which is the maximum length of any subset.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>", "model_name": "MagicCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPPNoTest", "nl": "Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.", "input_data": "largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ])", "expected_output": "4", "assertion": "assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4"}

The idea is to maintain a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to paint the fence with i posts and j colors.\n\nThe base cases are:\n\n- dp[1][j] = 1 for all j, as there is only one way to paint the fence with one post.\n- dp[2][j] = j, as there are j ways to paint the fence with two posts.\n\nFor the general case, dp[i][j] = (j-1)*(dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) for i > 2. This is because for each of the i-th post, there are j-1 ways to paint it different from the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th posts.\n\nHere is the Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef count_no_of_ways(n, k):\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for j in range(1, k+1):\n        dp[1][j] = 1\n        dp[2][j] = j\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            dp[i][j] = (j-1)*(dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j])\n    return dp[n][k]\n```\n\nThis function returns the number of ways to paint the fence with n posts and k colors.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>", "model_name": "MagicCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPPNoTest", "nl": "Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.", "input_data": "count_no_of_ways(2, 4)", "expected_output": "16", "assertion": "assert count_no_of_ways(2, 4) == 16"}
