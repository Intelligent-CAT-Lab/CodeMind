The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting.\n\nIn this case, the `key` function is a lambda function that takes an integer `x` and returns a tuple `(sum_of_digits, original_index)`. The `sum_of_digits` is calculated by converting the integer to a string, iterating over the digits, converting each digit back to an integer, and summing them up. The `original_index` is obtained by finding the index of `x` in the original list `nums`.\n\nIf two elements have the same sum of digits, the one with the smaller original index will come first. This is because the `sorted` function in Python sorts tuples lexicographically, and tuples are compared element by element. If the first element is equal, the second element is compared, and so on.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input list `nums` does not contain any non-integer elements. If it does, you may want to add error checking to handle these cases.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>", "model_name": "MagicCoder", "dataset_name": "HumanEvalNoTest", "nl": "\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    \"\"\"\n", "input_data": "order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) ", "expected_output": " [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]", "assertion": "assert order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])  ==  [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]"}
