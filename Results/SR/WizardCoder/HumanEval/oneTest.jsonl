It does this by iterating over all integers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if each integer is prime. If an integer is prime, it is added to the `primes` list. Once the length of the `primes` list equals `n`, the function returns the `primes` list.\r\n\r\nThe function uses a nested loop to check if each integer is prime. The outer loop iterates over all integers from 2 to `n-1`, and the inner loop iterates over all integers from 2 to the current integer minus 1. If the current integer is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime and the `is_prime` variable is set to `False`. If the current integer is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime and the `is_prime` variable is set to `True`.\r\n\r\nThe function returns the `primes` list once the length of the list equals `n`.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "HumanEval", "nl": "\ndef count_up_to(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n\n    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\n    \"\"\"\n", "input_data": "count_up_to(5) ", "expected_output": " [2,3]", "assertion": "assert count_up_to(5)  ==  [2,3]"}

It then returns a tuple of two values: the sum of digits and the index of `x` in the original list.
