Below is the translated version of the provided Python code into Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultiplyTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println(a * b);
    }
}
```

To compile and run this Java program, you would typically do the following:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.java` extension, for example, `MultiplyTwoNumbers.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile the Java program by running `javac MultiplyTwoNumbers.java`.
5. Run the compiled Java program by running `java MultiplyTwoNumbers`.
6. When prompted, enter the input (e.g., `20 2`).
7. The program will then output the result (e.g., `40`).
