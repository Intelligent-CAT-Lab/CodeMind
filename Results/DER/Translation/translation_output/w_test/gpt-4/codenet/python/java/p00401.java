Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code. This Java code reads an integer input from the user, doubles the `count` value until it exceeds `N`, and then prints `count` divided by 2 rounded to the nearest integer:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int count = 1;
        while (count <= N) {
            count *= 2;
        }
        System.out.println(count / 2); // Division of two integers automatically round towards zero
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In this Java snippet, the division operation on integers will already round towards zero, so there's no need to use the `round` function explicitly as we did in the Python code. The Java division will truncate any decimal part and give the integer part of the division result, akin to rounding down. Since we are dealing with positive numbers and halving `count` after the loop, we know that we will get a value that is effectively the same as "rounding" in this case. 

Here's a test case using the provided input `54`:

Test input:
```
54
```

Expected output:
```
32
```

Make sure to run this Java program on a platform that takes system input, like command line, IDE, or online Java execution environments.
