Here's the translated Java code:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((a + b) / 2);
    }
}
```

To run the provided test case in the Java program, you would input `1000 3000` in the console, and the program would print `2000` as the output.
