Certainly! Below is the translated Java code equivalent to the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MagicSquare {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = 0; i < (n - 2) / n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                int value = (i - ~((j ^ (n % 2 < (j + 2) ? n : i * 2)))) % n + 1;
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Please note, however, that the original Python code uses a backtick (\`) which is not standard Python. In older versions of Python, backticks were used for repr() which is equivalent to calling `toString()` in Java, but Python 2 also allows using it for the `eval(repr)` idiom, where repr is the string representation of an object. Backticks were removed in Python 3, so they should not be used.

Also, the `-(n < 3)` does not have an equivalent in Java and is not used in the context of this code. It seems the Python code provided may not function as intended for generating magic squares. If the original code was specifically designed with some non-standard Python interpretation or intentionally obfuscated, more context would be needed to create a direct translation. Otherwise, the translated code above assumes standard control flow and arithmetic operations, aiming to map the logic as closely as possible given the structure.

Let's ensure that the Java code works for any intended purpose or specifications you have. If there are other constraints or requirements, please specify them for a more accurate translation.
