Here's the equivalent Java code to replicate the Python code provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SubtractFromOne {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int inputNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(1 - inputNumber);
    }
}
```

Make sure to run this code within a class in order to execute it in a Java environment. The code uses the `Scanner` class for input, as is common in Java console applications.
