Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FibonacciModified {

    public static int fib(int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n];
        memo[0] = 2;
        memo[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
        }
        return memo[n - 1];
    }

    public static void solve() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(fib(N + 1));
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        solve();
    }
}
```

You can now compile and run this Java code. When you input the test case `5`, you should expect to get the output `11`, just like the original Python code.

Please note that in the Java version, we handle input using a `Scanner` object and encapsulate functionality into methods within a class. The arrays are zero-indexed in Java, so the initial values are assigned directly instead of using a slice notation as done in Python. The methods and the class must be declared as `static` if they are going to be used in the `static` `main` method without creating an instance of the class.
