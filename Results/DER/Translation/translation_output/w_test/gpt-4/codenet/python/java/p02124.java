Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code. In Java, you use a `Scanner` to read input from the console, and string concatenation is done using the `+` operator.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AiStringGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int inputValue = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        String output = "ai1333" + "3".repeat(inputValue / 100);
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

In this Java code:

1. I have imported the `Scanner` class to read input from the console.
2. I created a public class `AiStringGenerator`.
3. Inside the `main` method, I create a `Scanner` instance to read an integer input from the user.
4. I read the integer input and then close the scanner to avoid resource leaks.
5. I then use the `repeat` method of the `String` class to repeat the character `'3'`, `(inputValue / 100)` times, creating a string with that many `'3'` appended to `"ai1333"`.
6. I then print the final string to the console.

Note that the `repeat` method is available from Java 11 onward, so make sure you are using Java 11 or a later version. If you are using an older version of Java, you would need to create the repeated part using a loop. Here's how you could do it in Java 8 or earlier:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AiStringGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int inputValue = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        StringBuilder repeatedThrees = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < inputValue / 100; i++) {
            repeatedThrees.append("3");
        }
        
        String output = "ai1333" + repeatedThrees.toString();
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

To run this program, you would compile it with a Java compiler and then execute the class file, providing `0` as the test input. The program will print `ai1333` to the console as expected.
