Below is the translated code from Python to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BitwiseOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int mask = (1 << 32) - 1;

        System.out.println(String.format("%032d", new java.math.BigInteger(Integer.toBinaryString(n))));
        
        // In Java, we need a long type to accommodate the unsigned integer representation of ~n
        long invertedN = (~n) & mask;
        System.out.println(String.format("%032d", new java.math.BigInteger(Long.toBinaryString(invertedN))));
        
        long leftShiftedN = (n << 1) & mask;
        System.out.println(String.format("%032d", new java.math.BigInteger(Long.toBinaryString(leftShiftedN))));
        
        long rightShiftedN = (n >>> 1) & mask;
        System.out.println(String.format("%032d", new java.math.BigInteger(Long.toBinaryString(rightShiftedN))));
    }
}
```

Note the following modifications and considerations:
1. Java does not have built-in support for treating integers as unsigned, as Python does, so when negating `n` we have to use a long type to prevent sign extension and to accommodate the full 32-bit representation.
2. The >>> operator is used in Java for the logical (unsigned) right shift.
3. Java's standard library doesn't have a format specifier for binary strings like Python, thus `Integer.toBinaryString()` and `Long.toBinaryString()` methods are used, and we have to convert their return values to `BigInteger` in order to format them to fixed length, since the standard `String.format()` does not handle leading zeros on binary strings directly. 

Ensure this code is run with a Java environment configured with a standard input to meet the expectation of the `Scanner` expecting an int value.
