Here's the translated code from Python to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a * b);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program does the same thing as the provided Python code: it reads two integers from the standard input and prints their product. Make sure to compile the Java code and run it to test with your sample input.
