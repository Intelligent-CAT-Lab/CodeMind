Here's how you could translate the given Python code to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        
        if (a < b) {
            if (c < a) {
                System.out.println(c + " " + b);
            } else if (b < c) {
                System.out.println(a + " " + c);
            } else {
                System.out.println(a + " " + b);
            }
        } else {
            if (c < b) {
                System.out.println(c + " " + a);
            } else if (a < c) {
                System.out.println(b + " " + c);
            } else {
                System.out.println(b + " " + a);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Java program achieves the same functionality as the provided Python code. It takes three integers as input from the user, then applies the same conditional logic to determine and print the correct pair of integers. Don't forget to close the `scanner` to prevent resource leaks if it's a part of a bigger application, although for such a small program it might not be strictly necessary.
