Here is the translated code in Python, along with the way you can run a test case:

```python
# Get the input from the user as a string, split by spaces to a list and convert each item to an integer
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Conditional printing based on the modulus
if n % k == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(1)

# To run a test case manually, you can provide the inputs directly
# For example, for the input '7 3', you could do:
# test_input = "7 3"
# n, k = map(int, test_input.split())
# ...and then run the if-else logic as above.
```

To test the code with the provided test case '7 3', you can simply run the script and input '7 3' when prompted. The expected output will be '1', as indicated in the example test case.
