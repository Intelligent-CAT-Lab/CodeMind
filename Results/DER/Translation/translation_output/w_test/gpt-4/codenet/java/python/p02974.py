Below is the translated version of the provided Java code to Python. This Python code should take n and K as input parameters and provide the expected output as in the Java code example.

```python
import sys

def solve(n, K):
    if K % 2 == 1:
        return 0
    
    mod = 1000000007
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(2 * n * n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][n * n] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ndp = [[0 for _ in range(2 * n * n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n + 1):
            for k in range(2 * n * n + 1):
                if dp[j][k] == 0:
                    continue
                # add source
                if j + 1 <= n and k - i >= 0:
                    ndp[j + 1][k - i] = (ndp[j + 1][k - i] + dp[j][k]) % mod
                # add sink or local sink
                if j - 1 >= 0 and k + i <= 2 * n * n:
                    ndp[j - 1][k + i] = (ndp[j - 1][k + i] + (dp[j][k] * j * j) % mod) % mod
                # add intermediate point
                ndp[j][k] = (ndp[j][k] + (dp[j][k] * 2 * j) % mod) % mod
                # add isolated point
                ndp[j][k] = (ndp[j][k] + dp[j][k]) % mod
        dp = ndp
        
    return dp[0][K // 2 + n * n]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(n, K))
```

You can run this Python code by providing the input in the following format:

```
3 2
```

And it should produce the output:

```
2
```

This code takes `n` and `K` from the standard input and calls the `solve` function, which performs the same operations as the original Java code in a Pythonic way. It simulates the dynamic programming (DP) approach using a 2D list (equivalent to Java's array), iterating through possible states and transitions, and printing the result.
