Below is the translated Python code from your provided Java code:

```python
import sys
import math

class FastScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reader = (line.strip() for line in sys.stdin)
        self.tokenizer = []

    def next(self):
        while not self.tokenizer:
            self.tokenizer = next(self.reader).split()
        return self.tokenizer.pop(0)

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scanner = FastScanner()

    def solve(self):
        a = self.scanner.next_int()
        b = self.scanner.next_int()
        print(max(a + b, a - b, a * b))

    @staticmethod
    def exit():
        sys.exit(0)

def main():
    solver = Solver()
    solver.solve()
    solver.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code preserves the same logic and functionality from the original Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input and then outputs the maximum value obtained by either summing, subtracting, or multiplying these two numbers.

To test with the provided input:
```shell
echo "-13 3" | python p02945.py
```

If you put the Python code to a file named `p02945.py`, this command should provide you with the expected output `-10`.
