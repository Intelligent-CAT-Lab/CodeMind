Here is the Python translation of the provided Java code:

```python
def solve(k):
    return "ACL" * k

def show(answer):
    print(answer)

def main():
    k = int(input())
    answer = solve(k)
    show(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can use this Python script with an input `3` to get the expected output `ACLACLACL`.
