Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java snippet. Note that Python doesn't have the same I/O buffering and we won't require any assertion at the end, as we handle input differently. We will use the input function to read the test input and the print function for the output:

```python
def solve(n, d1, d2):
    d1s = 0
    d2s = 0
    while (d1 & 3) == 0:
        d1s += 1
        d1 >>= 2
    while (d2 & 3) == 0:
        d2s += 1
        d2 >>= 2
    need = n * n
    for i in range(2 * n):
        for j in range(2 * n):
            if (d1 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d1s) ^ (j >> d1s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d1 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d1s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d2s) ^ (j >> d2s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d2s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            print(i, j)
            need -= 1
            if need == 0:
                return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n, d1, d2 = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, d1, d2)
```

To use the Python code above with the provided test input, you would do something like this:

Test input via a command line:
```
echo "2 1 2" | python solution.py
```

Expected output on the command line would be:
```
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```

Please note that `solution.py` should be the name of the Python script containing the code. You will need to have the Python environment setup to run this command.
