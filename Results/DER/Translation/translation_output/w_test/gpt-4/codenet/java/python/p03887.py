Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import math
import sys

MOD = 1_000_000_007

def solve(n, a, b, c):
    if b % 2 == 1:
        return 0

    def combination(n, k):
        if k < 0 or k > n:
            return 0
        return (math.factorial(n) * pow(math.factorial(k), MOD - 2, MOD) *
                pow(math.factorial(n - k), MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD

    answer = 0
    for x in range(a, -1, -1):
        group1 = x

        restA = a - x
        group2 = restA

        restC1 = c - restA
        if restC1 < 0:
            break
        if b > 0:
            for y in range(restC1 // 3 + 1):
                group3 = y
                restC2 = restC1 - 3 * y
                group4 = b // 2

                count = combination(b // 2 + restC2 - 1, b // 2 - 1)
                count = count * combination(group1 + group2 + group3 + group4, group4) % MOD
                count = count * combination(group1 + group2 + group3, group3) % MOD
                count = count * combination(group1 + group2, group2) % MOD
                answer = (answer + count) % MOD
        elif restC1 % 3 == 0:
            group3 = restC1 // 3
            count = combination(group1 + group2 + group3, group3)
            count = count * combination(group1 + group2, group2) % MOD
            answer = (answer + count) % MOD
    return answer

def main():
    n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(n, a, b, c))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that I've assumed the input will be provided through standard input, similar to the Java version which reads from `System.in`. The `ContestReader` class from Java is replaced with Python's built-in `input()` function. The `ModCalculator` and `ModCombinationCache` classes were consolidated into a single function `combination` that calculates the combination using the factorial and modular inverse.

This python code assumes that Python's built-in arithmetic will not overflow for the constraints given. In case of large factorials that could exceed Python's integer limits, you could import `factorial` from `math` and adjust calculations to handle large numbers properly by using modular arithmetic as demonstrated in the code.

To test the Python solution you can run the script and provide the input as specified in the test case. For example:
```
3 1 2 0
```
And you should get the expected output:
```
2
```
