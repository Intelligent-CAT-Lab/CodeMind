Below you'll find the provided Java code translated into Python:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(X + 1)] for _ in range(512)] for _ in range(2)]
    
    for i in range(X + 1):
        dp[0][i][i] = 1
    
    t = 1
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(512):
            for x in range(X + 1):
                dp[t][j][x] = 0
        for j in range(512):
            sum_ = 0
            for k in range(X + 1):
                sum_ += dp[1 - t][j][k]
                sum_ %= MOD
                dp[t][j ^ k][k] += sum_
                dp[t][j ^ k][k] %= MOD
        t = 1 - t
    
    ans = sum(dp[1 - t][X][i] for i in range(X + 1)) % MOD
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running the provided test case with this code should yield the correct output:

Test input:
```
2 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

To check the code, simply run it in a Python environment and provide the test input when prompted.
