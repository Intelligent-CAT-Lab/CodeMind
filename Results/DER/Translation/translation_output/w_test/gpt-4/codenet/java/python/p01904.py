Translating the given Java code into Python involves converting Java-specific constructs and classes to their Python equivalents. Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import math
import sys
from functools import cmp_to_key

D = [1, 0, -1, 0]


def main():
    n = int(input())
    sqi = [0] * n
    sqj = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        x, d = [int(z) for z in input().split()]
        sqi[i] = sqi[x] + D[d]
        sqj[i] = sqj[x] + D[d ^ 1]

    pp = []
    for i in range(n):
        pp.append(Vector2(sqi[i], sqj[i]))
        pp.append(Vector2(sqi[i], sqj[i]+1))
        pp.append(Vector2(sqi[i]+1, sqj[i]))
        pp.append(Vector2(sqi[i]+1, sqj[i]+1))

    v = convex_hull(pp)
    m = len(v)
    theta = [0] * m
    for i in range(m):
        v1 = v[i]
        v2 = v[(i + 1) % m]
        theta[i] = math.atan2(v2.y - v1.y, v2.x - v1.x)

    theta.sort()
    min_area = float('inf')
    for i in range(m):
        l = theta[i]
        r = theta[i + 1] if i < m - 1 else (theta[0] + math.pi * 2)
        for j in range(90):
            x1 = (l * 2 + r) / 3
            x2 = (l + r * 2) / 3
            if area(v, x1) < area(v, x2):
                r = x2
            else:
                l = x1
        min_area = min(min_area, area(v, (r + l) / 2))
    
    print(f'{min_area:.6f}')


def area(v, theta):
    amax = float('-inf')
    amin = float('inf')
    bmax = float('-inf')
    bmin = float('inf')
    for p in v:
        cos = math.cos(theta)
        sin = math.sin(theta)
        a = p.x * cos + p.y * sin
        b = p.x * -sin + p.y * cos
        amax = max(amax, a)
        amin = min(amin, a)
        bmax = max(bmax, b)
        bmin = min(bmin, b)
    return (amax - amin) * (bmax - bmin)


class Vector2:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Vector2(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

    def cross(self, other):
        return self.x * other.y - self.y * other.x


def lex_compare(a, b):
    if a.x != b.x:
        return int(a.x - b.x)
    return int(a.y - b.y)


def convex_hull(points):
    points = sorted(points, key=cmp_to_key(lex_compare))
    n = len(points)
    q = []
    k = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while len(q) >= 2 and (q[-2] - q[-1]).cross(q[-1] - points[i]) <= 0:
            q.pop()
        q.append(points[i])
    t = len(q)
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        while len(q) >= t+1 and (q[-2] - q[-1]).cross(q[-1] - points[i]) <= 0:
            q.pop()
        q.append(points[i])
    q.pop()  # Remove the last point because it's the same as the first one
    return q


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

A few notes about the translation:

1. `Vector2` class methods are translated to instance methods with `self` referencing the current object.
2. Java's `compareTo` and `Comparator` interfaces are not present in Python; instead, we use Python's `cmp_to_key` function from the `functools` module to sort the points for the `convex_hull`.
3. The input/output part has been simply replaced by Python's `input()` and `print()` functions because Python's I/O is already buffered, so we don't need a custom `IO` class as in the Java code.
4. Java's `System.out.println` format specifiers are replaced with Python's `f-string` formatting.
5. I've assumed the input will be in the same format as in the Java code, with one pair of integers per line (after the initial integer).
6. The convex hull implementation is done with the Monotone Chain Algorithm (Andrew's algorithm). It may have slight differences to the original due to variations in how sorting and comparisons work between Java and Python.

Now, if you run this Python code for the given input `1`, you should get the expected output:

```plaintext
1.000000
```

Ensure to provide the correct input to the program; for the example, you just need to input `1`.
