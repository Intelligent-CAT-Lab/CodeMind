Certainly! The translated Python code will use `input()` function to read the input from the user instead of `BufferedReader`. Here's the Python equivalent:

```python
def main():
    s = input()  # Read input from stdin
    print(s.replace(",", " "))  # Replace commas with spaces and output the result

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

A sample test case using this Python code:

Test input:
```
happy,newyear,enjoy
```

Expected output:
```
happy newyear enjoy
```
