Here's the translated Python code along with an example of how to use it:

```python
# Input reading
X, Y = map(int, input().split())

if X % 2 == 0 or Y % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

# Test input: 3 4
# Expected output: Even
```

To test this code, you could input the test case directly in the Python script by specifying the values for `X` and `Y`, or you could simply run the script and provide the input `3 4` when prompted.
