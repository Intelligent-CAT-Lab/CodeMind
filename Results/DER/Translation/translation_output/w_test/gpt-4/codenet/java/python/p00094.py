Here is the equivalent Python code that performs the same operation as the given Java code snippet. It reads two floating-point numbers from standard input and computes their product divided by 3.305785. For simplicity, I'll assume we include the test case as input directly into the code with a comment, but in practice, you would provide this input externally when running the script.

```python
while True:
    try:
        inp = input()
        a, b = map(float, inp.split())
        print((a*b)/3.305785)
    except EOFError:
        break
```

If you want to run this with a single test case from the code itself, you could simulate standard input like this:

```python
import sys
from io import StringIO

# Simulate standard input for testing
test_input = "15 25"
sys.stdin = StringIO(test_input)

while True:
    try:
        inp = input()
        a, b = map(float, inp.split())
        print("{:.6f}".format((a*b)/3.305785))
    except EOFError:
        break
```

The `StringIO` object here is used to simulate standard input for testing purposes. Notice that I also formatted the output to display 6 decimal places to closely match the Java example's default printing behavior (although the exact output format wasn't specified in the original Java code). However, if you would like to replicate the exact output format from the Java code (which may vary depending on how Java's `println` decides to format the floating-point number), you should adjust the Python print format accordingly.
