Here is the translated Python code that will perform the same task as the provided Java code:

```python
# Read the input values from user
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# Check if the sum is greater than or equal to 22
if a + b + c >= 22:
    print("bust")
else:
    print("win")
```

You can test the above Python code with the provided test case. When you input "5 7 9", the script will output "win" just as expected.
