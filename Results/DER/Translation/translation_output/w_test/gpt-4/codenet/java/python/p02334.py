Here is the Java code translated into Python. I've chosen to represent the application as a collection of classes and methods, much like in the original Java example. Note that I've removed the explicit threading parts as that is not typically how Python is structured, and for simplicity's sake, I am assuming that the input is provided in a similar manner to the Java code, potentially from the command line.

```python
MOD = 1000000007  # Assuming a prime for modular inverse

class Combinatorics:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.fact = [1] * (n + 1)
        self.inv = [1] * (n + 1)
        self.finv = [1] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            self.fact[i] = self.fact[i - 1] * i % MOD
            self.inv[i] = MOD - self.inv[MOD % i] * (MOD // i) % MOD
            self.finv[i] = self.finv[i - 1] * self.inv[i] % MOD

    def combination(self, n, r):
        if n < r or r < 0:
            return 0
        return self.fact[n] * self.finv[r] % MOD * self.finv[n - r] % MOD

    def homogeneous(self, n, r):
        if n == 0 and r == 0:
            return 1
        return self.combination(n + r - 1, r)


def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())  # assuming input is provided as in the Java code example
    c = Combinatorics(n + k - 1)
    print(c.homogeneous(k, n))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

For the test input `"5 3"`, you would call the `main()` function, and it should print the expected output, `21`. You can provide the input manually when running the script or modify the script to accept arguments from the command line or another source.
