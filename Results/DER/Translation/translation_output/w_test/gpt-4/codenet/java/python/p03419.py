Below is the provided Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Define the function that replicates the functionality of the solve method in the Java code.
def solve(n, m):
    if n == 2 or m == 2:
        print(0)
    else:
        ans = max(1, n - 2) * max(1, m - 2)
        print(ans)

# Sample test case
solve(2, 2)  # Expected output: 0
```

In the Python code, I've translated the `solve` method into a Python function called `solve`. I've replaced the `Scanner` object with function parameters for `n` and `m`, which are expected to be provided when calling `solve`. Instead of using `System.out.println`, I've used the `print` function to output the result. The `main` method is not translated directly because typically in Python, you would call the function directly with the test input, as shown with the sample test case. The command-line input mechanism is not replicated in this Python translation since it's not part of the original problem's requirements.
