Below is the translated Python code that performs the same operation as the provided Java code. The expected input is a string that will be passed to the function `count_transformations` to get the result. 

```python
def count_transformations(s):
    length = len(s)

    cnt = 0
    l = 0
    r = length - 1
    while l <= r:
        cl = s[l]
        cr = s[r]

        if cl == cr:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            if cl == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                l += 1
            elif cr == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                cnt = -1
                break

    return cnt

# Test input
input_str = 'xabxa'

# Expected output
print(count_transformations(input_str))
```

This Python code defines a function `count_transformations` that takes a string as an argument and performs the same logic as the original Java code to calculate the required output. Finally, a test case is included to match the example given in the Java code.
