Here's the translated Python code for the Java code provided:

```python
# Python program equivalent to the provided Java code

def main():
    # Reading integer input
    a = int(input())

    # Calculating and printing the result
    print(a*a*3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To test the case where the input is 4, you'd run the Python program and input `4` when prompted, which would then output `48`.
