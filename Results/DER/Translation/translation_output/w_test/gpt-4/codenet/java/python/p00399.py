Here is the Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
# Read input from user
numDog_str = input().split(" ")

# Convert the string inputs to integers and calculate the sum
result = sum(map(int, numDog_str))

# Print the result
print(result)
```

You can use the following input to test the Python code in a similar manner as the Java code's sample test:

Test input:
`4 2 1 1`

Expected output:
`8`
