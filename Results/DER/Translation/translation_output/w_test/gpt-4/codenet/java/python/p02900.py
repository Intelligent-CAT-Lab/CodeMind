Below is the translated Python code corresponding to the provided Java code. I have used the `sys` library to read the input and left the function names similar to the original Java code for clarity:

```python
from math import gcd
import sys

def factors(n):  # returns a set of the prime factors of the number n
    fact = {1}
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            fact.add(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        fact.add(n)
    return fact

# Accepting the two input numbers from the standard input
numbers = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
a = numbers[0]
b = numbers[1]

# Calculating the size of the prime factors set of the greatest common divisor of a and b
print(len(factors(gcd(a, b))))
```

To run this script correctly, make sure to provide the input values before executing it, as it expects input from the standard input (`sys.stdin`). Alternatively, you can modify the script to accept input in a different manner, such as arguments or using input prompts if that's more convenient for your use case. 

Please note that Python's `math.gcd` function and Java's `gcd` method may have different implementations resulting in possible performance variances. Python's inbuilt `math.gcd` is used here for simplicity.
