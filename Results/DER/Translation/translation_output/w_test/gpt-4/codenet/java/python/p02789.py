Below is the translated Python code that achieves the same functionality as the provided Java code:

```python
# Reading input with two integer values n and m
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Comparing the values and printing "Yes" if they are equal, "No" otherwise
if n == m:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Run the above Python code with the test input:
```
3 3
```

This should produce the expected output:
```
Yes
```
