Here's the translated Python code for the provided Java sample:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    print(f"ABC{a}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To test the code with the input `100`, you would simply run the main function and enter `100` when prompted for input. The expected output would be `ABC100`.
