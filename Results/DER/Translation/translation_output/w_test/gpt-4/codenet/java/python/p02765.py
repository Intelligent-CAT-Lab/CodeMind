Here is the translated Python code which performs the same functionality as the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from the user
n, r = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
if n < 10:
    print(r + (10 - n) * 100)
else:
    print(r)

# Sample test case
# Input: 2 2919
# Output: 3719
```

To run the program, you can just copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or a script and provide the input as described. The program will then print out the expected output.
