Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Java code snippet:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Read input until EOF is reached
s = input().split()

# Count the frequency of each word
frequency = Counter(s)
# Find the word with the maximum frequency
max_freq_word = max(frequency, key=frequency.get)

# Find the longest word
longest_word = max(s, key=len)

print(max_freq_word, longest_word)
```

Now, let's use the provided test input to check if the code produces the expected output:

Test input:
`Thank you for your mail and your lectures`

Expected output:
`your lectures`

When you try this input with the Python script, it should indeed output "your lectures".
