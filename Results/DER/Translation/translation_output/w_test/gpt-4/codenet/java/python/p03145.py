Here is the translated code from Java to Python, wrapped in a code block. The given sample test case is also implemented in the last part of the code:

```python
# Read input as a string and split based on spaces
x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

# The formula to compute the result as in the Java code
result = (x * y) // 2

# Print the result
print(result)

# Implementing the test case you provided:
# Test input: 3 4 5
# Expected output: 6
# Since it's a Python script, you can run the script and input "3 4 5" to test it.
```

When you provide the test input "3 4 5" to this Python script, it will indeed output "6".
