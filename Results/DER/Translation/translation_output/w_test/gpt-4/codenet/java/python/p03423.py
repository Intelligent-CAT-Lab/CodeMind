Here's the translated Python code, along with how you might handle the input and print the output in Python:

```python
import math

def main():
    l = input()  # Read input from the console
    answer = math.floor(int(l) / 3)
    print(int(answer))  # Output the result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run the test case provided (input: 8), simply pass the input directly into the command line while running the Python script, and you'll get the expected output (2).
