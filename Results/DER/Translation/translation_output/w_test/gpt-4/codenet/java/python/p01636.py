Below is the translated Python code for the given Java snippet:

```python
def run():
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        head = a[:i]
        tail = a[i:]
        if head == "":
            h = 0
        elif head == "-":
            continue
        else:
            h = int(head)
        if tail == "":
            t = 0
        elif tail[0] == '0':
            continue
        else:
            t = int(tail)
        if t < 0:
            continue
        if h > t:
            continue
        if (h + t) % 2 != 0:
            continue
        if (t - h) % 2 != 0:
            continue
        ans += 1
    print(ans)

# Test case
run()
```

The above Python code assumes that the input will be provided in the same way as it's expected to be provided to the original Java version. When calling the `run()` function, it will wait for user input as per the `input()` in Python which corresponds to `Scanner` usage in Java. The provided test input "19" should be entered directly when the script is executed, resulting in the expected output being printed to the console.
