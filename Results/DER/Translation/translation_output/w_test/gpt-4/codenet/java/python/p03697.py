Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Read input from user
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Check condition and print the result
if a + b >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(a + b)
```

To test this Python code with the input "6 3", you would run the code and enter "6 3" in the console. The expected output, as per the given test case, would be "9".
