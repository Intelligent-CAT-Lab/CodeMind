Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java source:

```python
def modpow(a, n, mod):
    res = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1:
            res = res * a % mod
        a = a * a % mod
        n >>= 1
    return res

def solve(n):
    mod = 1000000007
    total = modpow(10, n, mod)
    partial = 2 * modpow(9, n, mod)
    both = modpow(8, n, mod)
    ans = (total - partial + both) % mod
    ans = (ans + mod) % mod
    print(ans)

# Sample test case
solve(2)
```

The Python version does not handle input and output the same way the Java code does. Instead, it takes the input `n` directly as an argument to the `solve` function and prints the output directly to the console. If you need to handle inputs for different cases, you would read from `input()` in Python and convert it to an integer before passing it to the `solve` function. Similarly, for Python, there is no need for the utility functions related to input and output buffering as provided in the Java version, so those have been removed.

Remember to run the Python code in an appropriate environment where you can provide input or change the `solve(2)` call to reflect the test case you want to execute.
