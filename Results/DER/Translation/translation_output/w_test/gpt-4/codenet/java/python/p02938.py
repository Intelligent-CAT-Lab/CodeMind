Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys

MOD = 1000000007

def go():
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    n = len(bin(r)) - 2
    dp = [[[[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for x in range(2):
        for y in range(2):
            for msb in range(2):
                dp[0][x][y][msb] = 1
                # Uncomment the line below to print the dp values like the original Java code's print method
                #print_dp(dp, 0, x, y, msb)
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for x in range(2):
            for y in range(2):
                for msb in range(2):
                    # flip neither, x needs to be in range
                    if x == 1 or get_bit(l, i-1) == 0:
                        # y is in range if already in range or current bit is 1
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i-1][x][y | get_bit(r, i-1)][msb]
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD
                    # flip both, y needs to be in range
                    if y == 1 or get_bit(r, i-1) == 1:
                        # msb gets flipped
                        # x is in range if already in range or current bit is 0
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i-1][x | (1-get_bit(l, i-1))][y][1]
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD
                    # flip only y, both need to be in range and msb needs to have been flipped
                    if ((x == 1 or get_bit(l, i-1) == 0) and
                            (y == 1 or get_bit(r, i-1) == 1) and
                            msb == 1):
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i-1][x][y][1]
                        dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD
                    # Uncomment the line below to print the dp values like the original Java code's print method
                    #print_dp(dp, i, x, y, msb)

    print(dp[n][0][0][0])

def print_dp(dp, i, x, y, msb):
    print(f"{i} {x} {y} {msb} = {dp[i][x][y][msb]}")

def get_bit(n, i):
    return (n >> i) & 1

# The 'main' method equivalent in Python.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    go()
```

The given test case to run would be:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The standard input can be simulated with following lines or by providing direct input to stdin.
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO('2 3') 
    go()
```

This code should output `3` as is expected from the provided sample test case. Remember that you need to provide the input `2 3` manually or modify the code to accept an input since the original Java code reads from standard input.
