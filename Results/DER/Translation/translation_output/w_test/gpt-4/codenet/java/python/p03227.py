Below is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Read the input from user
a = input()

# Reverse the string if its length is exactly 3
if len(a) == 3:
    a = a[::-1]

# Print the result
print(a)
```

This Python script will read a string from the standard input and reverse it if the string has exactly three characters, then print the result to the standard output.
