The following Python code is a direct translation of the provided Java code.

```python
import sys
from functools import reduce

# Constants
MOD = 10**9 + 7


def solve(n, m):
    # Make sure n is smaller
    if n > m:
        n, m = m, n

    # If difference is more than 1, the answer is 0
    if m - n > 1:
        print(0)
        return

    ans = 1
    # Calculate factorial of n and m
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans = (ans * i) % MOD
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        ans = (ans * i) % MOD

    # If n and m are equal, multiply by 2
    if n == m:
        ans = (ans * 2) % MOD

    print(ans)


def main():
    input_data = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    n, m = map(int, input_data.split())
    solve(n, m)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now, let's simulate a sample test case using the provided code. The input will be `2 2`, and we expect the output to be `8`.

```python
from io import StringIO

# Backup the reference of the standard input
original_stdin = sys.stdin

# Use StringIO to simulate stdin
sys.stdin = StringIO('2 2')

# Call the main function to process the simulated input
main()

# Restore the standard input to its original value
sys.stdin = original_stdin
```

Make sure you run this code within a Python environment. Note that the simulation code for the io should be run separately as it modifies `stdin`.
