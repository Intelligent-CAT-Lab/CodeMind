Here's the conversion of the Java code to Python:

```python
# Read the input as two integers separated by space
K, X = map(int, input().split())

# Check the condition and print the result
if X <= 500 * K:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Test this Python script using the provided example input and check if you receive the expected output.

Test input: `2 900`
Expected output: `Yes`
