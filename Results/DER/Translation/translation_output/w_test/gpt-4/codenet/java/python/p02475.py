Certainly! Here's the translated Java code into Python, using the `input()` function to read the input and the `BigInteger` equivalent in Python provided by the built-in `int` type which can handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

```python
# Online Python interpreter.
# You can write your code in this editor and execute it.

from sys import stdin

# Read input from stdin
a, b = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

# Output the division result
print(a // b)
```

For the provided sample test case with input `5 8`, you would run the code and input the values manually or pipe the inputs through a command line input when executing the Python script. The expected output would be `0` since Python's `//` operator is used for integer division, which is the equivalent of `BigInteger` division in Java.

You can run this code in any Python interpreter, and to test this particular sample case you can do the following:

1. Save the Python code in a file (e.g., `p02475.py`).
2. Execute it from the command line, providing the test input:

```sh
echo "5 8" | python p02475.py
```

This should output `0`.
