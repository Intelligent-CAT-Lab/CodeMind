The Java code provided appears to parse and count the depths within a sequence of parentheses and calculate a certain value based on these depths. This Java code could be translated to Python as follows:

```python
s = input().strip()

n = len(s)
count = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
now = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == '(':
        now += 1
    else:
        now -= 1
    count[now + n] += 1

now = 0
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == '(':
        now += 1
    else:
        now -= 1
    count[now + n] -= 1
    ans += count[now + n]

print(ans)
```

Note:
- `sc.nextLine()` in Java is replaced with `input().strip()` in Python to read a line of input.
- The use of arrays in Java is replaced with list comprehensions in Python, taking into account the zero-indexing in Python.
- The `println` and `print` statements are replaced with the `print` function in Python.
- The `deepToString` used in the `debug` method does not have a direct equivalent in Python, but this method appears to be for debugging purposes only and is not necessary for the functionality of the code.
- The `main` method is not needed in Python; the code will run directly.
- The Python code contains no classes and runs in a procedural style, starting from the `s = input().strip()` line.  

Let's test it using the provided test case.

Test input:
```
((()())())
```

Expected output:
```
10
```
