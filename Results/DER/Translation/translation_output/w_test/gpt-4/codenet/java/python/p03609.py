Certainly! The equivalent Python code, which performs the same functionality, would look something like this:

```python
# Get input from the user and split it into two integers x and t
x, t = map(int, input().split())

# Check if x is greater than t and print the difference, otherwise print 0
if x > t:
    print(x - t)
else:
    print(0)
```

You can use this code in a Python environment to get the expected output based on the input provided.
