Here's the translated Python code:

```python
# Test input
n = int(input())

# Main Processing
result = 0
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    result += i

# Output
print(result)
```

For a test case with input `2`, the expected output would be `1`. You can run this Python code, and it will provide the same functionality as the given Java code.
