Here's how the Java code above could be translated into Python:

```python
# Input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Conditional logic to check the sum and product
if a + b == 15:
    print("+")
elif a * b == 15:
    print("*")
else:
    print("x")
```

When you provide the input "4 11" to this Python code, the expected output would be "+", which matches the expected output of the original Java code.
