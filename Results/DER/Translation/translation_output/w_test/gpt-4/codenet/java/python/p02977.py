Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import sys


def main():
    n = int(input())
    if (n & -n) == n:
        print("No")
        return
    print("Yes")
    if n == 3:
        print("1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6")
        return
    k = bsr(n)
    for i in range(1, (1 << k) - 1):
        print(f"{i} {i + 1}")
    print(f"{(1 << k) - 1} {n + 1}")
    for i in range(1, (1 << k) - 1):
        print(f"{n + i} {n + i + 1}")
    print(f"{(1 << k) + 1} {n + (1 << k)}")
    print(f"{n + (1 << k)} {n + 1}")
    print(f"{n + 1} {n + (1 << k) + 1}")
    print(f"{n + (1 << k) + 1} {1 << k}")
    for j in range(2, n + 1 - (1 << k)):
        print(f"{n + j} {n + (1 << k) + j}")
        print(f"{n + (1 << k) + j - 1} {1 << k} + j")


def bsr(n):
    return n.bit_length() - 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python translation:

- The outer `p02977` class and the `main` method have been replaced with a simple `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the Python script.
- The `ExtendedScanner` and `Out` classes with their detailed method implementations for input and output operations are not needed as Python provides a much simpler way to read from and write to the standard IO.
- The `BitUtil` class's `bsr` method has been converted to a `bsr` function in Python using the `bit_length()` method available on integers.
- The Java IO and utilities classes such as `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, etc., have been omitted since Python handles input/output in a different manner.
- The `solve` method from Java has been integrated into the `main` function.
- Java's static typing is omitted in Python, which has dynamic typing.

Note: Given the complexity of the Java code, particularly with the more advanced I/O handling, the translation provided here uses Python's simple input and output functions (`input()` and `print()`). In a competitive programming context or where I/O performance is crucial, you may need to consider using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for input and buffering outputs, or even using PyPy as the interpreter for faster execution.
