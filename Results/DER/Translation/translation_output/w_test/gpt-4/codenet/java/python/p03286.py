Here's the Java code translated into Python:

Note: In Python, we don't typically create classes like `FastScanner` for input parsing as Python's standard input facilities are usually sufficient. For the sake of simplicity, I am using built-in functions to read the input.

```python
import math
import sys

dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def q(a, b):
    return math.floor(a / b) if b > 0 else math.ceil(a / b)

def r(a, b):
    return a - q(a, b) * b

def main():
    N = int(input())
    ans = "0" if N == 0 else ""
    while N != 0:
        quotient = q(N, -2)
        remainder = r(N, -2)
        ans = str(remainder) + ans
        N = quotient
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Consider using the built-in Python function `divmod()` to perform the division and modulo operations together. However, I've maintained similarity to the original code for the sake of following the structure you've provided.

Now let's test this with the provided test case:
```shell
# Test input:
-9
# Expected output:
1011
```

To run the program, you'd execute it from a Python environment and enter `-9` when prompted for an input. The program would then output `1011`.
