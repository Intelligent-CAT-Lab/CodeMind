Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Read the test input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the absolute difference
ans = abs(a - b)

# Print the expected output
print(ans)
``` 

To test the Python code with the provided test input (`20 30`), you should input `20 30` after running the code, and you should expect the output `10`.
