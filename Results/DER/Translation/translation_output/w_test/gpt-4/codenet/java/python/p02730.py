The Java code you've provided checks if the given string is a palindrome, and furthermore, also checks if the first half of the string is itself a palindrome. Below is the translated version of the same logic into Python:

```python
def check_palindromes(s):
    half_length = len(s) // 2
    
    # Check if the whole string is a palindrome
    for i in range(half_length):
        if s[i] != s[len(s) - 1 - i]:
            return "No"
    
    # Check if the first half of the string is a palindrome
    for i in range(half_length - 1):
        if s[i] != s[half_length - 1 - i]:
            return "No"
    
    return "Yes"

# Sample test case
print(check_palindromes("akasaka"))
```

This Python function `check_palindromes` takes a string `s` as input and returns "Yes" if the string and its first half are both palindromes, otherwise it returns "No". The sample test case will produce the expected output "Yes".
