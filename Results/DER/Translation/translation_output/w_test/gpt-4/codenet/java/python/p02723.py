Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Get the input string from the user
s = input()

# Check if the third and fourth characters are the same and if the fifth and sixth characters are the same
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Now you can use this Python script to input "sippuu" and the expected output will be "Yes".
