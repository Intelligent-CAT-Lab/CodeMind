Sure, here is the Python equivalent of the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from the user
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Perform the calculation and print the result
print((n-1)*(m-1))
```

This Python code assumes the input is given on one line, separated by a space, which matches the provided test case format (e.g., `3 4`).
