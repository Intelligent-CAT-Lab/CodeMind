Below is the translated Python code using Python's built-in functions and I/O methods. The input and output functionality is simplified since Python handles these functions differently from Java:

```python
import sys
from io import BytesIO
import os

# Fast scanner to emulate input reading behavior (optional for Python; you can use input())
class FastScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stdin = sys.stdin.buffer
        self.buffer = BytesIO()
        self.ptr = 0

    def read(self):
        self.buffer.seek(0)
        data = self.buffer.read()
        if not data:
            data = self.stdin.read(1024)
        self.buffer = BytesIO(data)
        return data

    def readline(self):
        while True:
            line = self.buffer.readline()
            if line:
                return line.decode('ascii').rstrip()
            else:
                self.read()

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.readline())


def print_numbers_missing_from_sum(N):
    table = [0] * (N + 1)
    table[0] = 0
    M = 0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + i
        if table[i] >= N:
            M = i
            break
    
    s = set(range(1, M + 1))
    s.remove(table[M] - N)
    for a in s:
        print(a)


def main():
    if os.isatty(sys.stdin.fileno()):  # Check if input comes from terminal/console
        sc = FastScanner()
        N = sc.next_int()
    else:  # Simpler input reading, such as file or redirect
        N = int(input().strip())
    print_numbers_missing_from_sum(N)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note that I've included a check to handle inputs both interactively and from a file or stream redirection. The original `FastScanner` Java class functionality has been condensed and adapted to fit common Python idioms for reading from `stdin`.

The `print_numbers_missing_from_sum` function encapsulates the original logic of the Java program. It first calculates the cumulative sum up to `N` and then removes the number that makes the sum exceed `N`, printing all other numbers in the sequence.

To test the above Python code:

```bash
echo "4" | python your_python_file.py
```

It should output:

```
1
3
```

Given that interacting with the console is more straightforward in Python, you often wouldn't need the `FastScanner` type of class and would use `input()` for reading input and `print()` for writing output directly.
