Below is the translated code from Java to Python. Please note that Python does not need explicit input stream handling for the simple case presented, hence the code is very succinct compared to the Java version.

```python
def solve(s):
    l = len(s)
    if (l % 2 == 0) != (s[0] == s[-1]):
        print("Second")
    else:
        print("First")

# Test input
s = input().strip()
solve(s)
```

To match the original Java code, you would provide the test input `"aba"` to this Python program. Upon execution, it should output `"Second"` as expected.
