Below is the translated Python code that performs the same function as the provided Java code:

```python
# Read the input from the user
x = int(input())

# Initial answer string
ans = "ai1333"

# Append '3' to the answer string for each increment of 100 in the input
for i in range(x // 100):
    ans += "3"

# Print the final answer
print(ans)
```

Using the provided test input of 0, this Python code will output 'ai1333' as expected.
