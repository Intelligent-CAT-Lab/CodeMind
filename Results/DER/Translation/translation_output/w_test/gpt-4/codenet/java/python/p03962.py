Here's the Java code translated to Python:

```python
paint_cans = set(input().split())
print(len(paint_cans))
```

Below is an example of how you might use this Python code with the test input provided:

```python
# Sample test input: "3 1 4"
# Expected output: 3

# Execute the Python code with the sample test input
paint_cans = set(input().split())
print(len(paint_cans))
```

When you run this Python code, you'd input "3 1 4" and the script would output "3", just like the original Java code.
