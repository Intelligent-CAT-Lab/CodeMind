Here is the translated Python code:

```python
# Read space-separated integers from input
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the products
product1 = a * b
product2 = c * d

# Print the maximum of the two products
print(max(product1, product2))
```

When you enter "3 5 2 7" as the input, the output will be `15`.
