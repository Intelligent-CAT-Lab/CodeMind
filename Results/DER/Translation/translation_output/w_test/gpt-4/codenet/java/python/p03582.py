Here is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
def solve():
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list_ = []
    for j in range(3):
        for i in range(a[j]):
            list_.append(chr(ord('a') + j))

    while len(list_) > 1:
        list_.sort()
        last = len(list_) - 1
        s = list_[0] + list_[last]
        list_[0] = s
        list_.pop(last)
    print(list_[0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

In this Python code, I used `list` instead of `ArrayList` since lists in Python are dynamic arrays like `ArrayList` in Java. The `sort()` method for Python lists is used instead of `Collections.sort()`. For input, the `input().split()` method along with `map(int, ...)` is used to get an array of integers (`na` in Java code). Also, to transform `'a'` to the next character, we use `chr(ord('a') + j)`.

Note that I removed all the multithreading and debugging parts since it's not typical to set up Python code in this way for simple script-like operations.
