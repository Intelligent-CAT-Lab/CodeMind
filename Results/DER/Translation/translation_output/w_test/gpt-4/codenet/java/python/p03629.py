Here is the Python equivalent code for the provided Java code. In this solution, I have used the `sys` module to read from standard input and `print` for output to keep it consistent with the simplicity of standard IO operations in Python.

```python
import sys

def solve():
    a = input()
    n = len(a)
    dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(26)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(26):
        dp[n][i] = [i, 1]

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(26):
            for k in range(2):
                dp[i][j][k] = dp[i + 1][j][k]

        cur = ord(a[i]) - ord('a')
        mi = 2 * n

        for j in range(26):
            mi = min(mi, dp[i + 1][j][1])

        for j in range(26):
            if dp[i + 1][j][1] == mi:
                dp[i][cur][0] = j
                dp[i][cur][1] = dp[i + 1][j][1] + 1
                break

    mi = 2 * n
    cur = -1

    for i in range(26):
        mi = min(mi, dp[0][i][1])

    for i in range(26):
        if dp[0][i][1] == mi:
            cur = i
            break

    ret = chr(ord('a') + cur)

    for i in range(n):
        if dp[i][cur][0] == dp[i + 1][cur][0] and dp[i][cur][1] == dp[i + 1][cur][1]:
            continue
        ret += chr(ord('a') + dp[i][cur][0])
        cur = dp[i][cur][0]

    print(ret)

# I'm assuming the input is directly provided via the standard input,
# similar to how Java's Scanner would read from System.in.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
```

Please note when reading strings in Python, there is no direct equivalent to Java's `InputReader`. In Python, it's common to use `input()` to read a line of text from standard input.

To run the provided test case, you might provide the input directly through the console or by using input redirection from a file containing the test case string.

For example:

```sh
python3 script.py < input.txt
```

Where `script.py` is the Python script containing the above code, and `input.txt` is a plain text file with the string `atcoderregularcontest`.
