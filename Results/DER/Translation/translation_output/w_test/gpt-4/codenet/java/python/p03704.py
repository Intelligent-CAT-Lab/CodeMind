Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def solve(D):
    ans = 0
    for len_ in range(len(str(D)), 19):
        res = dfs(D, 0, len_)
        ans += res
    print(ans)


def dfs(rem, pos, len_):
    if len_ - pos - 1 < pos:
        return 1 if rem == 0 else 0
    if pos == len_ - 1 - pos:
        return 10 if rem == 0 else 0
    
    d = 10 ** (len_ - pos - 1)
    dm = 10 ** pos
    d -= dm
    if abs(rem) >= 10 * d:
        return 0
    ret = 0
    for i in range(-9, 10):
        if pos == 0 and i >= 0:
            ret += dfs(rem - d * i, pos + 1, len_) * (9 - abs(i))
        else:
            ret += dfs(rem - d * i, pos + 1, len_) * (10 - abs(i))
    return ret


def main():
    # Assuming sys.stdin.read() provides the input stream in a similar way as Scanner(System.in) in Java
    import sys
    D = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())
    solve(D)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace this with actual test input or use sys.stdin.read()
    INPUT = "63"
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(INPUT)

    main()
```

For simplicity, `main()` is now assuming input provided as a string (later easily adaptable to read standard input) and uses `solve(D)` with test case `63`. The code also imports `sys` which is required for reading the input, although it has been replaced with a `StringIO` object for the hardcoded test case.

In the provided sample test, the code would work as is if the `63` were to be passed directly into the code, so you would comment out the `INPUT` and `StringIO` parts and make sure to read a proper integer value from `sys.stdin`.
