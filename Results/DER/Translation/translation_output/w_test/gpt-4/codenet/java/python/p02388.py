Below is the translated Java code to Python:

```python
def main():
    num = int(input())
    print(num ** 3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Since Python's standard input function works slightly differently from Java's BufferedReader, the equivalent in Python is the `input()` function for reading a line from stdin, converting it to an int with `int()`, and using `**` operator for exponentiation to calculate the cube of the number.

To run the test case with input "2", you would simply input 2 and press Enter. The expected output would be "8" as described.
