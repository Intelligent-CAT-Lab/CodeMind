Below is the translated Python code. Note that Python handles I/O differently than Java, so the `MyInput` class logic is replaced with direct stdin reads using `input()` for simplicity. Additionally, Python does not require passing input and output streams around or explicit flushing/closing of the output stream as in Java.

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print(0)
        return

    ans = 0
    base = 10
    while True:
        if base > n:
            break
        ans += n // base
        base *= 5
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, you can run the program and provide an input of `12` to test the functionality:

Example execution in a Python interpreter:

```sh
$ python translated_code.py
12
1
```

And this should give you the expected output of `1`.
