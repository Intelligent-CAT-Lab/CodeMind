The Java code you provided is quite comprehensive, and it implements a solution for a specific problem. The code contains several classes like `Solver`, which actually solves the problem, auxiliary classes like `ContestReader` for reading inputs, and other helper classes such as `ModCalculator`, `Algorithm`, and `UnionFind`.

Below is the equivalent Python code for the `Solver` class which appears to be the primary logic of the provided Java code. Additionally, a simple input processing logic is given to match the `ContestReader` class functionality in Java. Some of the mathematical and utility classes have been omitted since translating the full Java code would require an understanding of the specific problem context and purpose of these classes, which is not provided.

```python
class Solver:
    def __init__(self, k, n):
        self.k = k
        self.n = n

    def solve_k1(self):
        answers = [1] * ((self.n + 1) // 2)
        return answers

    def solve_k_even(self):
        answers = [self.k // 2] + [self.k for _ in range(1, self.n)]
        return answers

    def decrement(self, digits):
        for i in reversed(range(self.n)):
            if digits[i] > 1:
                digits[i] -= 1
                for j in range(i + 1, self.n):
                    digits[j] = self.k
                return
            elif digits[i] == 1:
                digits[i] -= 1
                return
    
    def solve_k_odd(self):
        digits = [(self.k + 1) // 2] * self.n
        for i in range(self.n // 2):
            self.decrement(digits)
        answers = [digit for digit in digits if digit > 0]
        return answers

    def solve(self):
        if self.k == 1:
            return self.solve_k1()
        elif self.k % 2 == 0:
            return self.solve_k_even()
        else:
            return self.solve_k_odd()

def main():
    k, n = map(int, input().split())
    solver = Solver(k, n)
    result = solver.solve()
    for number in result:
        print(number, end=' ')
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To test the Python code, you can use the test input provided, by either entering it manually or redirecting a file as input to the script. Please note that utility classes that are problem-specific may have to be implemented if they are needed for the completeness of the solution.
