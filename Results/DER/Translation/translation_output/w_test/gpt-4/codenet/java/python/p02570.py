Here is the Python translation of the provided Java code. The segment tree functionalities have been removed because they are not used in the main logic that determines the output based on `d`, `t`, and `s`.

```python
import sys
from io import StringIO

class p02570:
    @staticmethod
    def main(args):
        # Buffered reader setup for standard input capture.
        input_buffer = StringIO(sys.stdin.read())
        
        # Read the input from the buffer instead of direct IO calls.
        d, t, s = map(int, input_buffer.readline().strip().split())
        ans = d * 1.0 / s
        if ans <= t:
            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p02570.main(sys.argv)

# Additional data structures and functions are not translated as they are not utilized in the main program.
```

To use the above code, make sure to feed the input directly to the program using stdin. For example, if the program is saved in a file named `solution.py`, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
echo "1000 15 80" | python solution.py
```

This will provide the input (`1000 15 80`) to the Python script, and the output should be `Yes` as expected. Keep in mind that the additional classes and methods related to `SegmentTree`, `gcd`, `countD`, `intersect`, `pair`, and `pair2` are omitted, as your instructions were unclear about whether they needed to be translated as well. These functionalities were not used in generating the output for the given test input.
