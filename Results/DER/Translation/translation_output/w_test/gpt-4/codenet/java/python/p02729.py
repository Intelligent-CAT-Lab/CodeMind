Here's the translation of the Java code into Python:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

n_comb = n * (n - 1) // 2
m_comb = m * (m - 1) // 2

print(n_comb + m_comb)
```

This Python code will produce the same output as the Java code when provided with the same input. It reads two integers on a single line, separated by a space, calculates the number of combinations for each, and prints the sum.
