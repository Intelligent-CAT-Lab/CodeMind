Below is the translated Python code. Please note that the Java code provided had some unnecessary parts such as debug printing and methods for handling various unrelated tasks. I have focused mainly on the relevant logic for solving the problem and translated that into Python.

```python
import sys
import math
from collections import defaultdict

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input = sys.stdin.readline

    def solve(self):
        n, p = map(int, self.input().split())

        def get_factors(num):
            factors = defaultdict(int)
            d = 2
            while d * d <= num:
                while num % d == 0:
                    factors[d] += 1
                    num //= d
                d += 1
            if num > 1:
                factors[num] += 1
            return factors

        factors = get_factors(p)
        ans = 1
        for factor, count in factors.items():
            if count >= n:
                ans *= math.pow(factor, count // n)
        
        print(int(ans))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = Solver()
    solver.solve()
```
The sample test case can be ran for this Python code as follows:

```shell
echo "3 24" | python the_script.py
```

This should give the output `2`, which matches the expected output in the prompt.
