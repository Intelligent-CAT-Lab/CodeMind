Certainly! Below is the Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
def compute_answer(N):
    MOD = 1000000007
    cnt = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        temp = i
        j = 2
        while j * j <= temp:
            while temp % j == 0:
                cnt[j] += 1
                temp //= j
            j += 1
        if temp > 1:
            cnt[temp] += 1

    ans = 1
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        ans = (ans * (cnt[i] + 1)) % MOD

    return ans

# Sample test case
N = int(input())  # Test input: 3
print(compute_answer(N))  # Expected output: 4
```

You can use the `compute_answer(N)` function to compute the answer for various input cases. The sample test case is also included in the code above. When you run the Python script, you can input the test case `3`, and it should output `4`, as expected.
