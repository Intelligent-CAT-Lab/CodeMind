Below is the translated Java code for the given Python code snippet. It takes a string input similar to the one provided in the test case, splits it using the specified delimiter, and performs the necessary calculations before printing the output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String number = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] parts = number.split(" ");
        
        long a = Long.parseLong(parts[0]);
        long b = Long.parseLong(parts[1]);
        long k = Long.parseLong(parts[2]);
        
        long res = a - k;
        
        if (res < 0) {
            a = 0;
            b = b + res;
            b = b < 0 ? 0 : b;
        } else {
            a = res;
        }
        
        System.out.println(a + " " + b);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Please note that the delimiter used in the split method should match the delimiter used to separate the numbers in the input. However, in the provided test input, the delimiter seems to be a special character that is not easily identifiable. Please make sure that the delimiter used in the split method exactly matches the one used in your input data or adjust it accordingly. In standard cases, a space is used, so I used a single space in the `split(" ")` method. If the delimiter is indeed a special sequence of characters, you will need to replace `" "` with the correct sequence.
