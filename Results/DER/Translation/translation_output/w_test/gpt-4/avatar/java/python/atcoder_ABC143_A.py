Below is the translated Python code for the provided Java snippet. Note that the `if` statement needs a correction in the Java code (`if (A - (B * 2) > 0)`), and system output should be `System.out.println` (with a capital "S" for `System`). After correcting these Java code issues, here is the Python translation:

```python
# Read the input
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
if A - (B * 2) > 0:
    print(A - (B * 2))
else:  # Adding the else block to handle the case where the condition is not met.
    print(0)
```

Now, let's apply the provided test input:

```python
# Sample Test Case
input_str = '75 25'
inputs = input_str.split()
A = int(inputs[0])
B = int(inputs[1])

if A - (B * 2) > 0:
    print(A - (B * 2))
else:
    print(0)
```

If you run this Python code with the input "75 25" as indicated, the expected output would be "25".
