Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code along with the test case:

```python
def solve(n, k):
    return (n // k + 1) * k

# Test case input
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Output the result
print(solve(n, k))
```

To match the provided test input, you would run this Python code and input `999999999 1`, and it should output `1000000000` as expected.
