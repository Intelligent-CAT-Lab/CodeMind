Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java program:

```python
s = input()
ans = 0
c1 = 0
c0 = 0

for char in s:
    if char == '1':
        if c0 > 0:
            c0 -= 1
            ans += 1
        else:
            c1 += 1
    else:
        if c1 > 0:
            c1 -= 1
            ans += 1
        else:
            c0 += 1

print(ans * 2)
```

To run the test case with input `0`, you can simply run the program and provide `0` when prompted for input. The expected output will be `0`, as there are no two characters to pair and remove from the string (`c0` and `c1` will both end up as `1`, and `ans` will remain `0`).
