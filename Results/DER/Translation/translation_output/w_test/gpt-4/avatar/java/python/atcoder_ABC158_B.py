Below is the Python equivalent of the provided Java code:

```python
def solver(N, A, B):
    base = N // (A + B)
    mod = N % (A + B)
    if mod >= A:
        mod = A
    return base * A + mod

# Test input
N = 501719768609305159
A = 370614275896614890
B = 131105492712690269

# Expected output
print(solver(N, A, B))

# The output should be 370614275896614890
```

This Python function `solver` performs the same calculations as the Java code. It first computes how many complete sets of A and B will fit into N (stored in `base`), and then it calculates the leftover (stored in `mod`). If the leftover exceeds A, it gets capped to A. Finally, the function returns the total count of A (both from complete sets and the remaining part). The test case is provided to replicate the expected output.
