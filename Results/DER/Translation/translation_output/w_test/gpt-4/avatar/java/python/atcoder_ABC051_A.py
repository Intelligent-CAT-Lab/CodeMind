Here is the corresponding Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read the input as a single string
input_string = input()

# Split the string using ',' as the delimiter and unpack into variables
a, b, c = input_string.split(',')

# Print the output joined by spaces
print(a, b, c)
```

To test this with the provided input:
```
Test input: pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud,
Expected output: pnxnn muduhzn aquud
```

You would run the code and provide the input as follows:
```
# Run the Python program and type the following when prompted for input:
pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud,
```

The expected output will be:
```
pnxnn muduhzn aquud
```
