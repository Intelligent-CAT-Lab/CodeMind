## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates a program written in a high-level language into a program that can be run on a computer.

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a program that executes a program written in a high-level language.

## What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

## What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute.

## What is an object code?

An object code is a set of instructions that is not in a form that can be directly executed by the computer.

## What is source code?

Source code is a set of instructions that is in a form that can be executed by the computer.

## What is an executable?

An executable is a program that can be run on a computer.
