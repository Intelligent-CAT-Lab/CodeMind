## 10. 1000000007

Write a program that reads an integer from the standard input and outputs the remainder when the integer is divided by 1000000007.

### Input

The input is given in the following format:

```
n
```

### Output

Output the remainder when n is divided by 1000000007.

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^18

### Sample Input

```
1000000000000000000
```

### Sample Output

```
1
```

### Hint

The remainder when n is divided by 1000000007 is the same as the remainder when n is divided by 1000000007.

### Solution

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        System.out.println(n % 1000000007);
    }
}
