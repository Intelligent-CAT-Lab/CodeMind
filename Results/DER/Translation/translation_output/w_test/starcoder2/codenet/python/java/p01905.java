## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions to tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that a computer can understand.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates a program written in a high-level language into a program that a computer can understand.

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a program that executes a program written in a high-level language.

## What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language that is easy for humans to read and write.

## What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a programming language that is easy for computers to execute.
