## Problem

Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output.

## Input

Two integers separated by a space.

## Output

The sum of the two integers.

## Sample Input

```
1 2
```

## Sample Output

```
3
```

## Solution

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)
```

## Explanation

The `map` function applies a function to each element of an iterable. In this case, the `int` function is applied to ee `split` function splits a string into a list of strings, using the space character as a delimiter.

The `a, b = ...` syntax is called tuple unpacking, and it assigns the first element of the tuple to `a` and the second element to `b`.
