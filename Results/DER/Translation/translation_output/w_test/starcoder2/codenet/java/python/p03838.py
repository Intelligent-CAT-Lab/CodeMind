## Problem 1

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Problem 2

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.

Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

## Problem 3

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 4

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 5

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 6

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 7

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 8

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 9

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Problem 10

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is
