## 2. 10869

Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.

### Input

The first line contains two integers, A and B.

### Output

Print the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of A and B, each on a separate line.

### Sample Input

```
10 15
```

### Sample Output

```
25
-5
150
0
5
```

### Solution

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())
print(A + B)
print(A - B)
print(A * B)
print(A // B)
print(A % B)
```
