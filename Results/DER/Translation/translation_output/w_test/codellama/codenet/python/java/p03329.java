A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
127

Expected output:
4


```
import copy
N=int(input())
six = [6**i for i in range(1,8)][::-1]
nine = [9**i for i in range(1,8)] [::-1]
def DP(n):
	if n < 6:
		return n
	tmp = n
	count6 = 0
	count9 = 0
	for sixx in six:
		if sixx <= n:
			n -= sixx
			count6 = 1

This is the Java code for the given Python code. The code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java. The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to read input from the user. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it reads an integer `N` from the user using the `Scanner` class. The `six` and `nine` arrays are initialized with the powers of 6 and 9, respectively, and the `DP` method is called with the input `N` and the `six` and `nine` arrays as arguments. The `DP` method is a recursive function that calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert `N` into a palindrome. The method returns the minimum of `count6` and `count9`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to convert `N` into a palindrome. Finally, the `main` method prints the result of the `DP` method to the console.</s>
