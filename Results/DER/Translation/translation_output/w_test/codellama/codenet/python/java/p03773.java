Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
9 12

Expected output:
21


```
a,b = map(int,input().split())

print((a + b) % 24)

```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int sum = (a + b) % 24;
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two integers.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the input strings to integers.
* The `print()` method is used to print the result.

Note: The `%` operator is used to calculate the remainder of the division of `a` and `b` by 24.</s>
