Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
1 2
2 1


```
from itertools import permutations
for p in list(permutations(range(1, int(input())+1))): print(*p)

```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Permutations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        Stream<int[]> permutations = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n).boxed().permutations();
        permutations.forEach(p -> System.out.println(p[0] + " " + p[1]));
    }
}
```
This code uses the `permutations()` method of the `IntStream` class to generate all the permutations of the numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the input provided by the user. The `forEach()` method is then used to print each permutation on a new line.

Note that the `permutations()` method returns a `Stream<int[]>` object, which is a stream of integer arrays. Each integer array represents a permutation of the input numbers. The `forEach()` method is used to iterate over the stream and print each permutation.</s>
