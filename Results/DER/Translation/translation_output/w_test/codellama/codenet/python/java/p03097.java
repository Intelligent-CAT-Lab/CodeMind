Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2 1 3

Expected output:
YES
1 0 2 3


```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
def pop_count(x):
	res = 0
	for i in range(17):
		res += ((x>>i)%2 == 1)
	return res
if (pop_count(a^b)) % 2 == 0:
	print("NO")
else:
	print("YES")
	def f(m, x, y):
		if m == 1:
			if x == 0:
				return [0, 1]
			else:
				return [1, 0]

		res = [x]

				diff = i
				break
		s = (x % (2**diff)) + (((x // (2**(diff+1))) * 2**(diff+1)) >> 1)
		t = (y % (2**diff)) + (((y // (2**(diff+1))) * 2**(diff+1)) >> 1)
		#return s, t
		u = s^1

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic as the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int popCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 17; i++) {
            if ((a ^ b) % 2 == 1) {
                popCount++;
            }
        }
        if (popCount % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("NO");
        } else {
            System.out.println("YES");
            int[] result = f(n, a, b);
            for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
                System.out.print(result[i] + " ");
            }
        }
    }

    public static int[] f(int m, int x, int y) {
        if (m == 1) {
            if (x == 0) {
                return new int[] { 0, 1 };
            } else {
                return new int[] { 1, 0 };
            }
        }

        int[] res = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if ((x >> i) % 2 != (y >> i) % 2) {
                int diff = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        int s = (x % (2 << diff)) + ((x / (2 << (diff + 1))) * 2 << (diff + 1)) >> 1;
        int t = (y % (2 << diff)) + ((y / (2 << (diff + 1))) * 2 << (diff + 1)) >> 1;

        int u = s ^ 1;
        int[] left = f(m - 1, s, u);
        int[] right = f(m - 1, u, t);

        int x_bit = (x >> diff) % 2;
        int y_bit = (y >> diff) % 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i] % (2 << diff) + (2 << diff) * x_bit + ((left[i] / (2 << diff)) * 2 << diff) << 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < right.length; i++) {
            right[i] = right[i] % (2 << diff) + (2 << diff) * y_bit + ((right[i] / (2 << diff)) * 2 << diff) << 1;
        }

        return left + right;
    }
}
```
Note that this code is not optimized for performance, and it may not produce the same output as the Python code for large inputs.</s>
