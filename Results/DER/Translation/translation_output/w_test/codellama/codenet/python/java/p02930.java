Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3

Expected output:
1 2
1


```
n = int(input())
for i in range(n+1):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
      x = i^j
      ct = 0
      while (x>0):
        x //= 2
        ct += 1
      print(ct,end=" ")
    print("")

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int x = i ^ j;
                int ct = 0;
                while (x > 0) {
                    x /= 2;
                    ct++;
                }
                System.out.print(ct + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `for` loop to iterate over the input. The `^` operator is used to perform the bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers, and the `while` loop is used to count the number of set bits in the result. Finally, the `System.out.print` method is used to print the result.</s>
