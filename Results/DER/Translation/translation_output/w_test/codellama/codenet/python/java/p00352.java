Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1000 3000

Expected output:
2000


```
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print((a+b)//2)

```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int sum = (a + b) / 2;
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the two parts of the input string into integers.
* The `print()` method is used to print the result to the console.

Note: The `//` operator is used for integer division, which returns the integer part of the result.</s>
