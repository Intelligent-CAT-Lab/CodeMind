Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Thank you for your mail and your lectures

Expected output:
your lectures


```
a = list(input().split())
print(max(a, key=a.count), max(a, key=len))

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] words = input.split(" ");
        String mostFrequentWord = "";
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            int frequency = 0;
            for (String otherWord : words) {
                if (word.equals(otherWord)) {
                    frequency++;
                }
            }
            if (frequency > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = frequency;
                mostFrequentWord = word;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(mostFrequentWord);
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach to the Python code, but it is written in Java. It first splits the input string into an array of words using the `split()` method. Then, it iterates over the array of words and counts the frequency of each word using a nested loop. Finally, it prints the most frequent word.

Note that the `max()` method is not used in this code, as it is not available in Java. Instead, the code uses a nested loop to find the most frequent word.</s>
