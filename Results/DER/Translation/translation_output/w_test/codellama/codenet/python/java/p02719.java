Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
7 4

Expected output:
1


```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

rot = n//k
x = n

if k == 1 or n == k or n%k == 0:
  x = 0
elif rot >= 1:
  x = n - k*rot
  
t = x%k

print(min(t, abs(t-k)))
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();

        int rot = n/k;
        int x = n;

        if (k == 1 || n == k || n%k == 0) {
            x = 0;
        } else if (rot >= 1) {
            x = n - k*rot;
        }

        int t = x%k;

        System.out.println(Math.min(t, Math.abs(t-k)));
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math.min` and `Math.abs` methods to calculate the minimum and absolute value of `t` and `t-k`, respectively. The `Math.min` method returns the smaller of its two arguments, and the `Math.abs` method returns the absolute value of its argument.

The code first reads in two integers `n` and `k` from the user using the `Scanner` class. It then calculates the number of rotations `rot` that can be performed on the array, and the final position of the element `x` after the rotations.

If `k` is 1 or `n` is equal to `k` or `n` is divisible by `k`, then the element is not moved and `x` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `rot` is greater than or equal to 1, then the element is moved to the end of the array and `x` is set to `n - k*rot`.

Finally, the code calculates the minimum distance between the final position of the element and the original position, and prints the result.</s>
