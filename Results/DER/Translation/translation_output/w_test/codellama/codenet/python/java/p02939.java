Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
aabbaa

Expected output:
4


```
S = input()

l = [0] * (len(S) + 1)
l[1] = 1
if S[0] == S[1]:
    l[2] = 1
else:
    l[2] = 2

for i in range(3, len(S)+1):
    if S[i-1] != S[i-2]:
        l[i] = l[i-1] + 1
    else:
        l[i] = l[i-3] + 2

print(l[-1])

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.nextLine();
        int[] l = new int[S.length() + 1];
        l[1] = 1;
        if (S.charAt(0) == S.charAt(1)) {

        } else {
            l[2] = 2;
        }
        for (int i = 3; i <= S.length(); i++) {
            if (S.charAt(i - 1) != S.charAt(i - 2)) {
                l[i] = l[i - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                l[i] = l[i - 3] + 2;

This code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It first reads a string from the user using the `Scanner` class, and then it initializes an array `l` with the length of the string plus one. The first two elements of the array are initialized to 1, and the third element is initialized based on whether the first two characters of the string are the same or not.

The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, it iterates over the string and checks if the current character is the same as the previous two characters, if it's not, it adds 1 to the current element of the array, otherwise it adds 2.

Finally, it prints the last element of the array, which is the length of the longest substring of the string that does not contain any repeated characters.</s>
