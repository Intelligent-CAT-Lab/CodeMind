Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 5

Expected output:
Possible


```
# ABC067 A - Sharing Cookies
a,b = map(int,input().split())

if a%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif b%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif (a+b)%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
else:
    print('Impossible')
```
[/INST]
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SharingCookies {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a % 3 == 0 || b % 3 == 0 || (a + b) % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Possible");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Impossible");
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
* The `Scanner` object is created to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `if` statement is used to check if any of the conditions are true.
* The `print` method is used to print the output.

Note: The code is written in Java 8, which is the latest version of Java.</s>
