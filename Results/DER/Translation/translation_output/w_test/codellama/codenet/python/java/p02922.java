Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 10

Expected output:
3


```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
total = 1
ans = 0

while total < b:
    ans += 1
    total += a-1

print(ans)

```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int total = 1;
        int ans = 0;

        while (total < b) {
            ans += 1;
            total += a - 1;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `map` function to convert the input string to an integer. The `while` loop is used to calculate the number of times the loop will run, and the `ans` variable is used to keep track of the number of times the loop has run. Finally, the `System.out.println` method is used to print the result.</s>
