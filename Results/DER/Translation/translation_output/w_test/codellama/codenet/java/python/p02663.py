Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
10 0 15 0 30

Expected output:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02663 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int h1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int h2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int k = nextInt(scanner);
        int h = h2 - h1;
        int m = m2 - m1;
        int day = (h * 60) + m;
        System.out.println(day - k);

    }

    public static int nextInt(Scanner scanner) {
        return Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
    }
}

```
import sys

def main():
    h1, m1, h2, m2, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    h = h2 - h1
    m = m2 - m1
    day = (h * 60) + m
    print(day - k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code. The `map` function is used to convert the input string to a list of integers, and the `split` method is used to split the input string into a list of strings. The `int` function is used to convert the strings to integers. The `readline` method is used to read a line of input from the standard input stream. The `print` function is used to print the result to the standard output stream.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run as a standalone program, and not when it is imported as a module.</s>
