Here is the Python code that solves the problem:
```python
import sys

def solve():
    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    d = list(S)
    dp = [1] * 13
    base = 1
    for i in range(len(d) - 1, -1, -1):
        next_dp = [0] * 13
        if d[i] == '?':
            for k in range(10):
                for j in range(13):
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007
        else:
            k = int(d[i])
            for j in range(13):
                next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007
        dp = next_dp
        base *= 10
        base %= 13
    print(dp[5])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
This code uses the same approach as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It reads the input from stdin, converts it to a list of characters, and then uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to decode the input. The code is similar to the Java code, but it uses Python's built-in `range` function and list comprehensions to simplify the code.

The `solve` function reads the input from stdin, converts it to a list of characters, and then uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to decode the input. The code is similar to the Java code, but it uses Python's built-in `range` function and list comprehensions to simplify the code.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program, it calls the `solve` function and prints the result to stdout.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the code is only executed when the file is run as a script, and not when it is imported as a module.

Note that the code assumes that the input is a string of digits and question marks, and it does not perform any error handling.</s>
