A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
serval

Expected output:

			int max=0;
			int cur=0;
			for(int j=0; j<s.length(); ++j){
				if(s.charAt(j)==target) cur = 0;
				else{
					cur++;
					max = Math.max(max, cur);
				}

```python
import math

def solve(s):
    ans = 101
    for i in range(26):
        target = chr(i + ord('a'))
        max_val = 0
        cur_val = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] == target:
                cur_val = 0
            else:
                cur_val += 1
                max_val = max(max_val, cur_val)
        ans = min(ans, max_val)
    return ans

print(solve(s))
```
This code uses the same logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It first defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of consecutive characters that are not the same.

The function first initializes the `ans` variable to 101, which is the maximum possible value. It then loops over the 26 possible characters (a-z) and for each character, it initializes the `max_val` and `cur_val` variables to 0.

The function then loops over the characters in the input string `s` and for each character, it checks if it is the same as the current character being considered. If it is not, it increments the `cur_val` variable and updates the `max_val` variable to the maximum of the current `max_val` and `cur_val`. If the character is the same as the current character, it sets `cur_val` to 0.

After looping over all the characters in the input string, the function updates the `ans` variable to the minimum of the current `ans` value and the `max_val` value for the current character.

Finally, the function returns the `ans` value, which is the minimum number of consecutive characters that are not the same.

The code then calls the `solve` function with the input string "serval" and prints the result.</s>
