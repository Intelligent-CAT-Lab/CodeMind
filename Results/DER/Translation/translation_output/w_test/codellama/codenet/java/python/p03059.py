import java.util.*;


public class p03059 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int amount = 0;
      	int time = a;  
      
        for(int i = 2; time <= c + 0.5; i++){
            amount += b;
          	time = a * i;
        }
        
        System.out.println(amount);
    }
}
```

```
import math

def main():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    amount = 0
    time = a
    for i in range(2, int(math.ceil(c / a)) + 1):
        amount += b
        time *= i
    print(amount)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code uses the `math.ceil()` function to round up the value of `c / a` to the nearest integer, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of values from 2 to the rounded-up value. For each iteration, the code adds `b` to `amount` and multiplies `time` by `i`. Finally, the code prints the value of `amount`.

Note that the `math.ceil()` function is used instead of `math.floor()` because the problem statement says that the amount of money is "at least" the amount of money that would be earned if the person worked for `c` hours.</s>
