Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
7

Expected output:
4


```
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p03644 {
    public static PrintWriter out;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        p03644.run();
    }

    private static void run() {
        out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        out.println(count(Integer.parseInt(sc.next())));
        out.close();
        sc.close();
    }

    private static int count(int pnum) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; (int) Math.pow(2, i) <= pnum; i++) {
            result = (int) Math.pow(2, i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```python
import math

def count(pnum):
    result = 0
    for i in range(0, int(math.log(pnum, 2)) + 1):
        result = int(math.pow(2, i))
    return result

def main():
    pnum = int(input())
    print(count(pnum))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:

The `count` function takes an integer `pnum` as input and returns the number of times the number 2 needs to be squared to reach or exceed `pnum`.

The `main` function takes an integer input from the user and prints the result of the `count` function with that input.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to indicate that the `main` function should be executed only when the script is run as a standalone program, and not when it is imported as a module.

The `math.log` function is used to calculate the logarithm of `pnum` to the base 2, which gives the number of times the number 2 needs to be squared to reach or exceed `pnum`. The `math.pow` function is used to calculate the power of 2 to the calculated logarithm.

The `range` function is used to create a range of integers from 0 to the calculated logarithm, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over the range and calculate the power of 2 for each iteration. The `result` variable is updated with the calculated power of 2 for each iteration.

The `print` function is used to print the final result, which is the number of times the number 2 needs to be squared to reach or exceed `pnum`.</s>
