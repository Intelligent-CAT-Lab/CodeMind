import sys

def main():
    tail = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    n = len(tail)
    tailsp = tail.split("")
    zero = "0"
    one = "1"
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0 and tailsp[i] == zero:
            count += 1
        if i % 2 == 1 and tailsp[i] == one:
            count += 1
    n -= count
    if count > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note: The code is written in Python 3.x.

Explanation:

The code first reads the input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. It then splits the input string into a list of characters using `split("")`.

The code then iterates over the list of characters and checks if the character at each index is equal to "0" or "1". If the character is "0" and the index is even, it increments the count by 1. If the character is "1" and the index is odd, it increments the count by 1.

After the loop, the code subtracts the count from the length of the input string and checks if the result is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints the count.

The code is written in a function called `main()` and is executed when the script is run. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the code is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.</s>
