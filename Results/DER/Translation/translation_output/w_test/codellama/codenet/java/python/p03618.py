5


```
import java.util.*;

public class p03618 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		char[] A = sc.next().toCharArray();

		int[] cnt = new int[26];
		for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
			cnt[A[i]-'a']++;
		
		long ans = (long)N*(N+1)/2+1;
		for(int i=0; i<26; i++)
			if(cnt[i]>0)
				ans -= (long)cnt[i]*(cnt[i]+1)/2;

```python
import sys

def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    cnt = [0] * 26
    for c in s:
        cnt[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
    ans = n * (n + 1) // 2 + 1
    for i in range(26):
        if cnt[i] > 0:
            ans -= cnt[i] * (cnt[i] + 1) // 2
    return ans

s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
print(solve(s))
```
This is a Python implementation of the Java code provided. The `solve` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string. The implementation is similar to the Java code, with the only difference being that Python uses `ord` to get the ASCII value of a character, and `chr` to get the character corresponding to an ASCII value.

The `solve` function first calculates the number of distinct characters in the string using a hash map `cnt`, where the key is the ASCII value of the character and the value is the number of times the character appears in the string.

Next, the function calculates the total number of distinct characters in the string by summing up the values in the hash map.

Finally, the function subtracts the number of distinct characters that appear more than once in the string from the total number of distinct characters to get the final answer.

The `main` function simply reads a string from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, calls the `solve` function with the string as input, and prints the result to standard output using `print`.</s>
