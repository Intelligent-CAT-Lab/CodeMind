def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def solve(x, y):
    g = gcd(x, y)
    m = x + y - g
    if x % 2 == 0 or y % 2 == 0 or x == y or (x % 2 > 0 and y % 2 > 0):
        return m + 1
    else:

x = int(input())

```

Explanation:

The `gcd` function is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The `solve` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and calculates the greatest common divisor using the `gcd` function. It then calculates the sum of `x` and `y` minus the greatest common divisor, and returns the result.

The `if` statement checks if any of the following conditions are true:

* `x` is even or `y` is even
* `x` is equal to `y`
* both `x` and `y` are odd

If any of these conditions are true, the function returns the sum of `x` and `y` minus the greatest common divisor plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `x` and `y` minus the greatest common divisor.

The `input` function is used to read the input from the user, and the `print` function is used to print the output.
