```python
import sys

def main():
    S = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    yy = S // 100
    mm = S % 100

    if 1 <= yy <= 12 and 1 <= mm <= 12:
        print("AMBIGUOUS")
    elif 1 <= yy <= 12:
        print("YYMM")
    elif 1 <= mm <= 12:
        print("MMYY")

    main()
```

Explanation:

* The `import sys` statement is used to import the `sys` module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
* The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and it reads the input from the standard input stream using the `sys.stdin.readline()` method.
* The `S` variable is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer representing the date in the format `YYMMDD`.
* The `yy` variable is assigned the value of the year part of the date, which is obtained by dividing the `S` variable by 100.
* The `mm` variable is assigned the value of the month part of the date, which is obtained by taking the remainder of the division of the `S` variable by 100.
* The `if` statement checks if the year and month parts of the date are valid, and if they are, it prints "AMBIGUOUS". If the year part is valid but the month part is not, it prints "YYMM". If the month part is valid but the year part is not, it prints "MMYY". If neither the year nor the month part is valid, it prints "NA".
* The `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement is used to indicate that the `main()` function should be executed only if the script is run as a standalone program, and not if it is imported as a module.</s>
