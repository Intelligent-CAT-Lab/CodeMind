This code is similar to the Java code, but it uses Python's built-in `set` data structure to keep track of the numbers that have been seen before. It also uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

The `solve` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of steps required to reach `n` from `7` using the given operation. If the operation leads to a cycle, the function returns `-1`.

The code first computes the number `num` that is closest to `n` and greater than `n`. It then starts a loop that iterates until `num` is equal to `n`. Inside the loop, the code checks if `num` is already in the set of seen numbers. If it is, the function returns `-1` to indicate that the operation leads to a cycle. Otherwise, the code adds `num` to the set and increments the counter `res`.

Finally, the code returns the value of `res`, which is the number of steps required to reach `n` from `7` using the given operation.</s>
