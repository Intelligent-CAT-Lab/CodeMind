Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
99992

Expected output:
311


```
from cmd import IDENTCHARS
n = int ( input ( ) )
l = 1
r = n
while ( l < r ) :
    mid = l + ( r - l ) // 2
    idxcnt = mid * ( mid + 1 ) / 2
    if ( idxcnt < n ) :
        l = mid + 1
    else :
        r = mid
l -= 1
idxcnt = l * ( l + 1 ) / 2
print ( int ( n - idxcnt ) )


```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int l = 1;
        int r = n;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            int idxcnt = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (idxcnt < n) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        l -= 1;
        idxcnt = l * (l + 1) / 2;
        System.out.println(n - idxcnt);
    }
}
```
This code uses the same approach as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It first prompts the user to enter a number, and then it uses a binary search algorithm to find the smallest number that has at least the given number of indices. The code then prints the difference between the given number and the smallest number with at least that many indices.

Here's an example of how the code works:

* The user enters the number 99992.
* The code sets `l` to 1 and `r` to 99992.
* The code then enters a loop that continues until `l` is greater than `r`.
* In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the midpoint of the range between `l` and `r`, and then calculates the number of indices that have a value less than or equal to the midpoint.
* If the number of indices is less than the given number, the code sets `l` to the midpoint plus 1. Otherwise, the code sets `r` to the midpoint.
* The code continues this process until `l` is greater than `r`, at which point it sets `l` to `l - 1` and calculates the number of indices that have a value less than or equal to `l`.
* Finally, the code prints the difference between the given number and the number of indices that have a value less than or equal to `l`.

In this case, the code would output 311, which is the difference between 99992 and 311.</s>
