Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();

        if (A + B < C) {
            System.out.println("No");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the user, adds them together, and checks if the sum is less than the third integer. If it is, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".
