Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int i = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(n + 1 - i);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads two integers from the user, adds 1 to the first integer, and subtracts the second integer from the result. The result is then printed to the console.
