Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        if (s.charAt(2) == s.charAt(3) && s.charAt(4) == s.charAt(5)) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the 3rd and 4th characters are the same as the 5th and 6th characters, and prints "Yes" if they are, and "No" if they are not.
