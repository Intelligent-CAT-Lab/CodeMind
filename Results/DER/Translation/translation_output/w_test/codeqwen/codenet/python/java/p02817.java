Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.next();
        String T = scanner.next();

        System.out.println(T + S);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads two strings from the user, concatenates them, and prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the user. The `next()` method is used to read the next string entered by the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result.
