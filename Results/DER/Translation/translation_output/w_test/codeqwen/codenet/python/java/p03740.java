Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (Math.abs(x - y) <= 1) {
            System.out.println("Brown");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Alice");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints "Brown" if the difference is less than or equal to 1, and "Alice" otherwise.
