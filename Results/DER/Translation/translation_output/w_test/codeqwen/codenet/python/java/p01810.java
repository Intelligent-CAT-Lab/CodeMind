Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            a += a / (k - 1) + 1;
        }
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, performs the same operations as the Python code, and prints the result.
