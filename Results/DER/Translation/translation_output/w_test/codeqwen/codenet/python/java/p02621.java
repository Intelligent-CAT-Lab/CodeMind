Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a + a * a + a * a * a);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the sum of the number and its square and cube, and then prints the result.
