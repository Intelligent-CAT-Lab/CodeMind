Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        int output = (int) (input / 500) * 500;
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the user, performs integer division by 500, and then multiplies the result by 500 to get the final output. The output is then printed to the console.
