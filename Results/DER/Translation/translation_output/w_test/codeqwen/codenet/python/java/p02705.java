Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        double result = input * 6.28;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This Java program reads an integer from the user, multiplies it by 6.28, and then prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the user. The `nextInt()` method is used to read the integer input, and the `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result.
