Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a == b) {
            System.out.println(c);
        } else if (b == c) {
            System.out.println(a);
        } else {
            System.out.println(b);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the third integer. If not, it prints the integer that is not equal to the other two.
