Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("ABC" + input);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads a string from the user, concatenates it with "ABC", and then prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. The `nextLine()` method is used to read a line of text from the user.
