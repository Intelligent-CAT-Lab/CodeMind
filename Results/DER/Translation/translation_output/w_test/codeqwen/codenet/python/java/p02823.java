Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if ((A - B) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println((B - A) / 2);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Math.min(A - 1, N - B) + 1 + (B - A) / 2);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the difference between A and B, checks if the difference is even or odd, and then prints the appropriate result.
