Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n - 1) / 2);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads an integer from the user, subtracts 1 from it, and then divides the result by 2. The result is then printed to the console.
