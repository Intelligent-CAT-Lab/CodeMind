Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (Math.abs(b - c) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Alice");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Borys");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between the second and third integers, and checks if this difference is even. If it is, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Borys".
