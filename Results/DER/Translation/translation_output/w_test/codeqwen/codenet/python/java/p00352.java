Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((a + b) / 2);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads two integers from the user, adds them together, and then divides the sum by 2 to find the average. The result is then printed to the console.
