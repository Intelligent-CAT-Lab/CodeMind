Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def run():
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    base = n*100 + m*1800
    print(base << m)

run()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the base value by multiplying the first integer by 100 and the second integer by 1800, and then prints the result of shifting the base value left by the second integer.
