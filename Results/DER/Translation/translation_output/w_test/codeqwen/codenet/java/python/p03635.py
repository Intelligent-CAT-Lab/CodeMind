Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print((n-1)*(m-1))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, subtracts 1 from each, and then multiplies the results together. The `map` function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers. The `input().split()` function is used to split the input string into a list of words, and then `map(int, ...)` is used to convert each word in the list to an integer.
