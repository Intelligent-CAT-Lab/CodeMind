Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
T = int(input())
X = int(input())
a = T / X
print(a)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, divides the first by the second, and prints the result. The `int()` function is used to convert the user input from strings to integers.
