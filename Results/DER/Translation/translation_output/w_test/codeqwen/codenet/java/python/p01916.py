Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
import sys

class p01916:
    def solve(self):
        s = input()

        a = [0]*26
        b = [0]*1111

        for i in range(len(s)):
            a[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] += 1

        for i in range(26):
            b[a[i]] += 1

        for i in range(999, -1, -2):
            if b[i] > 0:
                b[i] -= 1
                break

        m = 0

        for i in range(1, 1001, 2):
            m += b[i]

        if m % 2 == 0:
            print(m//2)
        else:
            print(m//2 + 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = p01916()
    p.solve()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, counts the frequency of each character in the string, and then calculates the number of pairs of characters that can be formed from the string. The number of pairs is then printed to the standard output.
