Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print(c, a, b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user input, then prints them in the reversed order. The `map` function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers, and the `split` function is used to split the input string into a list of words, where each word is a number. The `print` function is used to print the numbers in the reversed order.
