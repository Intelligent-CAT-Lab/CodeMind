Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    k = int(input())
    
    if k == 1:
        ans = 0
    else:
        ans = n - k
    
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, subtracts the second integer from the first, and prints the result. If the second integer is 1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the two integers.
