Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if b >= a:
    print(a)
else:
    print(a-1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then checks if the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. If it is, it prints the first integer. If it isn't, it prints the first integer minus one.
