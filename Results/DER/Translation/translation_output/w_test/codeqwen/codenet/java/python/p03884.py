Here is the Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve(k):
    dptable = [[0]*8 for _ in range(601)]
    dptable[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, 601):
        dptable[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(1, 8):
            dptable[i][j] = dptable[i-1][j] + dptable[i][j-1]
    
    countC = [0]*601
    for i in range(600, 0, -1):
        while k >= dptable[i][7]:
            countC[i] += 1
            k -= dptable[i][7]
    
    sb = ""
    for i in range(1, 601):
        sb += "FESTIVA"
        sb += "L"*countC[i]
    return sb

def main():
    k = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print(solve(k))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the standard input, solves the problem, and prints the result to the standard output. The `solve` function is the same as the `solve` function in the Java code. The `main` function is the same as the `execute` function in the Java code. The `ContestReader` class is not used in the Python code, so it is not included. The `ModCalculator`, `ModCombinationCache`, `Algorithm`, and `UnionFind` classes are not used in the Python code, so they are not included.
