Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
i = 1
while i * (i + 1) // 2 < x:
    i += 1
print(i)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then enters a loop that continues until the sum of the first `i` natural numbers is greater than or equal to the input number `x`. The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, and when the loop condition is no longer met, it prints the final value of `i`.
