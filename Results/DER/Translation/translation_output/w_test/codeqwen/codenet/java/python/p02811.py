Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    K = int(input())
    X = int(input())

    if X <= 500*K:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if the second integer is less than or equal to 500 times the first integer, and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
