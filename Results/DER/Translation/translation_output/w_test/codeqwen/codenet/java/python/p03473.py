Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    M = int(input())
    result = (24 - M) + 24
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the result, and prints it. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
