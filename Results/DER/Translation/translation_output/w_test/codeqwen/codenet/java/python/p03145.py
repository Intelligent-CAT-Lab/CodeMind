Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    
    print((x*y)//2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads three integers from the user, multiplies them, and then divides the result by 2. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java.
