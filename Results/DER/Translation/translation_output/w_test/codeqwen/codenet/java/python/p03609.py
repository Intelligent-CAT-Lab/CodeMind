Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x, t = map(int, input().split())
if x > t:
    print(x - t)
else:
    print(0)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, `x` and `t`, and then checks if `x` is greater than `t`. If it is, it prints the difference between `x` and `t`. If `x` is not greater than `t`, it prints `0`.
