Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n, 1000):
    if i % 111 == 0:
        print(i)
        break
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then loops through all integers from that number to 999. If it finds an integer that is divisible by 111, it prints that integer and breaks out of the loop.
