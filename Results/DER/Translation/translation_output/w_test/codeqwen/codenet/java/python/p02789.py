Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
if n == m:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, compares them, and prints "Yes" if they are equal and "No" if they are not.
