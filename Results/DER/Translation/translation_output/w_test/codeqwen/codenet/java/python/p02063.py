Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import time

startTime = time.time()

A = int(input())
B = int(input())

for i in range(B + 1, 10**10):
    if (i & 0xFF) == 0 and time.time() - startTime > 3.5:
        break
    ca = i // A + i % A
    remb = i % B
    cb = i // B + remb // A + remb % A
    if ca < cb:
        print(i)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then it iterates over all integers from `B + 1` to `10**10`. If the current integer `i` is divisible by `0xFF` (which is equivalent to `255` in decimal) and the time elapsed since the start of the program is more than 3.5 seconds, it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it calculates the values of `ca` and `cb` and checks if `ca` is less than `cb`. If it is, it prints the current integer and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without finding a suitable integer, it prints `-1`.
