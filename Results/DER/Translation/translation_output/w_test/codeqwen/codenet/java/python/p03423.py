Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    answer = n // 3
    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, divides it by 3, and prints the result. The `//` operator in Python performs integer division, which is equivalent to `Math.floor` in Java.
