Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    lines = input().split(" ")
    upper = lines[1][0]
    print("A" + upper + "C")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a line of input, splits it into words, takes the second word, and then prints the first letter of that word in uppercase followed by "AC".
