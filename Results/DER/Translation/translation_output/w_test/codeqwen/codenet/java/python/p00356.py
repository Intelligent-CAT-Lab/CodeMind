Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    p = 0
    a = x
    b = y
    while x % y != 0:
        z = x
        x = y
        y = z % y
    m = a + b - y

    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 or a == b or a % 2 > 0 and b % 2 > 0:
        print(m + 1)
    else:
        print(m)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, and then calculates the sum of the two numbers minus the GCD. If either of the numbers is even, or if both numbers are the same, or if both numbers are odd, it adds 1 to the result before printing it. Otherwise, it just prints the result.
