Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
num = int(input())

answer = 180 * (num - 2)

print(answer)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the answer by multiplying 180 by the number of sides minus 2, and then prints the answer.
