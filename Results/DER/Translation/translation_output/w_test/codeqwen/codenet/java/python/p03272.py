Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(N - K + 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, subtracts the second integer from the first, and then adds 1 to the result. The result is then printed to the console.
