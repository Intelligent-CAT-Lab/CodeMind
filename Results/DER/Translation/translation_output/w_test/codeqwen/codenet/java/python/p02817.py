Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    string = input()
    tString = input()
    print(tString + string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two strings from the user, concatenates them, and prints the result. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
