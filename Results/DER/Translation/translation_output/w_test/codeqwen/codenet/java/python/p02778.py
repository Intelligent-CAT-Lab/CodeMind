Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
s = input()

for i in range(len(s)):
    print("x", end="")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string from the user, and then prints out the same number of "x" characters. The `end=""` argument in the `print` function is used to prevent a newline character from being printed after each "x".
