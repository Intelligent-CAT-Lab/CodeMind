Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs((N-2) * (M-2)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the absolute value of the product of the two numbers subtracted by 2, and then prints the result. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
