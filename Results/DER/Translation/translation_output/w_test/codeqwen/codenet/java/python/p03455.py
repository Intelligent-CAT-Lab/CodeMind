Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    X = int(input())
    Y = int(input())
    if X%2==0 or Y%2==0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if either of them is even, and prints "Even" if it is, or "Odd" if it isn't.
