Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()

    print((len(s) - s.count('o'))*100+700)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, counts the number of 'o's in the string, and then prints the result of multiplying the count by 100 and adding 700.
