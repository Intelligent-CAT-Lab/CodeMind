Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    a = input()
    marbles = a.count('1')
    print(marbles)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string input from the user, counts the number of '1's in the string, and prints the count. The `count` method of a string in Python is equivalent to the `indexOf` method of a string in Java.
