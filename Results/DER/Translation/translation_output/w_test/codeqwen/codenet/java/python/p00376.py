Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    ans = abs(a - b)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and then prints the result. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
