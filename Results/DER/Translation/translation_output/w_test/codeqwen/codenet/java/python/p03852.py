Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
c = input()

if c == "a":
    print("vowel")
elif c == "i":
    print("vowel")
elif c == "u":
    print("vowel")
elif c == "e":
    print("vowel")
elif c == "o":
    print("vowel")
else:
    print("consonant")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a character from the user, checks if it's a vowel, and prints the corresponding output.
