Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
N = int(input())
print((N + 1) // 2)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, adds 1 to it, and then divides it by 2, rounding down to the nearest whole number. The result is then printed to the console.
