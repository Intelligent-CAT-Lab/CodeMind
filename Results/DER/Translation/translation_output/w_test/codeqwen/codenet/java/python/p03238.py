Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())
if n == 1:
    print("Hello World")
else:
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a + b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, checks if it's 1, and if it is, it prints "Hello World". If it's not 1, it reads two more integers and prints their sum.
