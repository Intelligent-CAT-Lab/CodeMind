Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
n = b - a
print(n * (n + 1) // 2 - b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the difference between them, and then prints the sum of all integers from 1 to the difference minus the difference itself. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java for integer division.
