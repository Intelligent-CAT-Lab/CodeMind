Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    while True:
        try:
            a, b = map(float, input().split())
            print((a*b)/3.305785)
        except EOFError:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two numbers from the user, calculates the product of the two numbers and divides it by 3.305785, and then prints the result. The `try` and `except` block is used to handle the `EOFError` which is thrown when there is no more input to read.
