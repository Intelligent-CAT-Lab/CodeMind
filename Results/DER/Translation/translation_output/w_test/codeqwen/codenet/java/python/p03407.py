Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def solve(testNumber, inp, out):
    out.write("Yes" if inp.readline().strip() + inp.readline().strip() >= inp.readline().strip() else "No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    solve(1, sys.stdin, sys.stdout)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the standard input, adds them together, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the third integer. If it is, it writes "Yes" to the standard output; otherwise, it writes "No". The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `solve` function when the script is run directly.
