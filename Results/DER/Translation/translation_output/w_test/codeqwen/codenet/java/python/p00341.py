Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
from collections import Counter
import sys

def main():
    e = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]

    if len(set(e)) > 3:
        print("no")
        return

    e.sort()
    for i in set(e):
        if Counter(e)[i] != 4 and Counter(e)[i] != 8 and Counter(e)[i] != 12:
            print("no")
            return

    print("yes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code reads the input from the standard input, converts it to integers, and stores it in a list. It then checks if the number of distinct elements in the list is more than 3. If it is, it prints "no" and returns. If not, it sorts the list and checks if the count of each distinct element is 4, 8, or 12. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints "no" and returns. If all conditions are met, it prints "yes".
