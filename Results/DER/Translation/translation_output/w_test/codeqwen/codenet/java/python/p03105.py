Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    C = int(input())
    N = B // A
    if N > C:
        print(C)
    else:
        print(N)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the integer division of the second integer by the first, and then prints the smaller of the two results.
