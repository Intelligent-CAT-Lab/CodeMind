Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if a <= 8 and b <= 8:
    print("Yay!")
else:
    print(":(")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if they are both less than or equal to 8, and prints "Yay!" if they are, or ":(" if they are not.
