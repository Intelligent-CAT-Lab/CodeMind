Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    odd = 0
    for i in range(3):
        odd += int(input()) % 2
    print("Hom" if odd >= 2 else "Tem")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, counts the number of odd numbers, and then prints "Hom" if there are at least two odd numbers, or "Tem" otherwise.
