Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def solve(K):
    return "ACL" * K

def main():
    K = int(input())
    print(solve(K))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then prints "ACL" repeated that number of times. The `solve` function does the repetition, and the `main` function reads the input and calls `solve` to get the result.
