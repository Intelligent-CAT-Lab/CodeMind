Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import math

def execute(n):
    r = math.sqrt(n)
    return int(r * r)

def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(execute(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the square root of the integer, squares the result, and prints the result. The `execute` function is a helper function that does the calculation, and the `main` function is the main entry point of the program.
