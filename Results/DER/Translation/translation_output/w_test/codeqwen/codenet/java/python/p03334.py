Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    d1 = int(input())
    d2 = int(input())
    d1s = 0
    d2s = 0
    while (d1 & 3) == 0:
        d1s += 1
        d1 >>= 2
    while (d2 & 3) == 0:
        d2s += 1
        d2 >>= 2
    need = n * n
    for i in range(2 * n):
        for j in range(2 * n):
            if ((d1 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d1s) ^ (j >> d1s)) & 1) != 0):
                continue
            if ((d1 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d1s) & 1) != 0):
                continue
            if ((d2 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d2s) ^ (j >> d2s)) & 1) != 0):
                continue
            if ((d2 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d2s) & 1) != 0):
                continue
            print(i, j)
            if (need == 0):
                return
            need -= 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        solve()
    except Exception as e:
        e.print_exc()
        sys.exit(1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the number of pairs of coordinates that satisfy the conditions, and prints them to the standard output. If the number of pairs is less than the required number, it stops printing and returns. If an exception occurs during the execution, it prints the exception and exits with a non-zero status.
