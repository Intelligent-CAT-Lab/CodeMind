Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    str = input()
    if str == "":
        return
    else:
        res = int(str)
        han = 0
        ni_beki = 1
        ruijyo = 0
        while True:
            han = (res >> ruijyo) % 2
            if han == 0:
                res = (res % ni_beki) + 1
                break
            else:
                ni_beki = ni_beki * 2
                ruijyo += 1
        print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then finds the smallest number that is greater than the input number and has the same binary representation. The binary representation of the number is obtained by shifting the bits of the input number to the right and taking the remainder when divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. If the remainder is 1, the number is left unchanged and the process is repeated. The process continues until a number with the same binary representation is found. The smallest such number is printed to the console.
