Here is the Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        good = ["dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser"]
        poss = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        poss[0] = True
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if not poss[i]:
                continue
            for out in good:
                if i + len(out) > len(s):
                    continue
                match = 0
                for a in range(len(out)):
                    if out[a] == s[i+a]:
                        match += 1
                if match == len(out):
                    poss[i+match] = True
        print("YES" if poss[-1] else "NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads the input from the standard input, processes it, and writes the output to the standard output. The main function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the string, checks if it's possible to form the string by concatenating the strings in the good list, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
