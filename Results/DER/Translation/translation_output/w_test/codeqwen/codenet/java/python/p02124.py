Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    x = int(input())
    ans = "ai1333"
    for i in range(x // 100):
        ans += "3"
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, adds "3" to the string "ai1333" for each 100 units in the input number, and then prints the resulting string.
