Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if a-b == b-c:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the difference between the first and second integers, and then checks if this difference is the same as the difference between the second and third integers. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
