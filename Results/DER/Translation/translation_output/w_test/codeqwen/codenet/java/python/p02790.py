Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a >= b:
    print(b * a)
else:
    print(a * b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then prints the larger of the two integers repeated the number of times equal to the smaller integer.
