Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    i = int(input())
    ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60]
    print(ans[i])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, uses it as an index to access an array of integers, and then prints the value at that index. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
