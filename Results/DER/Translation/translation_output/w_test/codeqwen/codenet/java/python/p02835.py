Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if a + b + c >= 22:
    print("bust")
else:
    print("win")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, adds them together, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust", otherwise it prints "win".
