Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    ab = abs(a-b)
    ac = abs(a-c)
    bc = abs(b-c)
    if ac <= d or (ab <= d and bc <= d):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads four integers from the user, calculates the absolute differences between the pairs of numbers, and checks if any of these differences is less than or equal to the fourth number. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
