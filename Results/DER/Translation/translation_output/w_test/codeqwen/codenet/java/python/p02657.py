Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
print(A*B)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, multiplies them, and prints the result. The `int()` function is used to convert the input strings to integers.
