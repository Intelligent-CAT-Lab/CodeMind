Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
helix = input()
if helix == "A":
    print("T")
elif helix == "T":
    print("A")
elif helix == "C":
    print("G")
elif helix == "G":
    print("C")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string from the user, and then prints the corresponding string based on the input. The `input()` function in Python is equivalent to `scanner.next()` in Java. The `if` and `elif` statements in Python are equivalent to the `switch` statement in Java.
