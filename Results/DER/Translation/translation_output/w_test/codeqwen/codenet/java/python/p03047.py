Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(n - k + 1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, subtracts the second integer from the first, and then prints the result. The `map` function is used to convert the input strings into integers. The `input().split()` function is used to read the input from the user and split it into two parts based on whitespace.
