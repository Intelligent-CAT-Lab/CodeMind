Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        if (x == 1) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            System.out.println(1);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, checks if it's equal to 1, and prints 0 if it is, or 1 if it's not.
