Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
s = input()
c = s[0]
print(chr(ord(c) + 1))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, gets the first character of the string, and then prints the ASCII character that is one more than the ASCII value of the character. The `ord()` function returns the ASCII value of a character, and the `chr()` function returns the character that has a specific ASCII value.
