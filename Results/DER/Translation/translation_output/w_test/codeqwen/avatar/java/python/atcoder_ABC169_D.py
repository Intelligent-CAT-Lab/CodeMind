Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
def prime_factor(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        count = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            n /= i
            count += 1
        if count != 0:
            factors.append(count)
        i += 1
    if n != 1:
        factors.append(1)
    return factors

def main():
    N = int(input())
    factors = prime_factor(N)
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(factors)):
        pow = factors[i]
        increase = 1
        while pow - increase >= 0:
            pow -= increase
            increase += 1
            count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It first defines a function `prime_factor` that calculates the prime factors of a given number. Then, in the `main` function, it reads an integer from the standard input, calculates the prime factors of this number, and finally prints the count of the prime factors.
