Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    str = input()
    
    if str == "AAA" or str == "BBB":
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, checks if it is "AAA" or "BBB", and prints "No" if it is, and "Yes" otherwise. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
