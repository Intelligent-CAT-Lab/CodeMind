Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve(t, s, q):
    sum = 0
    while s < t:
        s = s * q
        sum += 1
    return sum

def main():
    t, s, q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    print(solve(t, s, q))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads the input from the standard input, calls the `solve` function with the input values, and prints the result. The `solve` function works the same way as the `solve` method in the Java code. It calculates the number of times the value `s` needs to be multiplied by `q` before it is greater than or equal to `t`. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it calls `main` when the program is run.
