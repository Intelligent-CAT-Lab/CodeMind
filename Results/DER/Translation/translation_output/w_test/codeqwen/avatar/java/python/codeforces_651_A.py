Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    num1, num2 = map(int, input().split())
    counter = 0
    
    while num1 != 0 and num2 != 0:
        if num1 == 1 and num2 == 1:
            break
        
        if num1 <= num2:
            num1 += 1
            num2 -= 2
        else:
            num1 -= 2
            num2 += 1
        
        counter += 1
    
    print(counter)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then enters a loop that continues until either `num1` or `num2` is 0. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `num1` is less than or equal to `num2`. If it is, it increments `num1` by 1 and decrements `num2` by 2. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, it decrements `num1` by 2 and increments `num2` by 1. The loop continues until `num1` and `num2` are both 0, at which point it prints the value of `counter`.
