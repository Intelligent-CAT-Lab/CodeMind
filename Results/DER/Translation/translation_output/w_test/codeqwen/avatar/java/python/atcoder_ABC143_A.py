Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())
print(A - (B * 2) if A - (B * 2) > 0 else 0)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, subtracts twice the second integer from the first, and prints the result. If the result is negative, it prints 0 instead.
