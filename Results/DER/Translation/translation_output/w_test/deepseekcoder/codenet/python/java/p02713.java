<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
9


```
from math import gcd
K = int(input())
ans = 0

for a in range(1, K+1):
    for b in range(1, K+1):
        for c in range(1, K+1):
            ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c)

print(ans)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;

        for (int a = 1; a <= K; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= K; b++) {
                for (int c = 1; c <= K; c++) {
                    ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c);
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer `K` from the standard input, then calculates the sum of the greatest common divisors (gcd) of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all between 1 and `K` inclusive. The result is printed to the standard output.

The `gcd` method is a common Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two integers. It uses the property that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)`.
