<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
13 3 1

Expected output:
3


```
X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())

answer=0
width=Y+2*Z
while(width<=X):
  answer+=1
  width+=Y+Z
  
print(answer)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = scanner.nextInt();
        int Y = scanner.nextInt();
        int Z = scanner.nextInt();

        int answer = 0;
        int width = Y + 2 * Z;
        while (width <= X) {
            answer++;
            width += Y + Z;
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the input, calculates the width of the first piece of paper, and then counts how many more pieces of paper can be fitted into the remaining space. The result is printed to the console.
