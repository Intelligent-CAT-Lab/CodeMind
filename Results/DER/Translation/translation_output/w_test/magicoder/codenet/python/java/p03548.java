<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
13 3 1

Expected output:
3


```
X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())

answer=0
width=Y+2*Z
while(width<=X):
  answer+=1
  width+=Y+Z
  
print(answer)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = scanner.nextInt();
        int Y = scanner.nextInt();
        int Z = scanner.nextInt();

        int answer = 0;
        int width = Y + 2 * Z;
        while (width <= X) {
            answer++;
            width += Y + Z;
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the width of the first piece of wood, and then counts how many pieces of wood can be fitted into the remaining space. The result is printed to the standard output.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
