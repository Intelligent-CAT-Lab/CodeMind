<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
sippuu

Expected output:
Yes


```
s = input()
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        if (s.charAt(2) == s.charAt(3) && s.charAt(4) == s.charAt(5)) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads a string from the user, then checks if the third and fourth characters are the same as the fifth and sixth characters. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
