<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
90

Expected output:
4


```
x = int(input())

for i in range(1, 10**5):
    if 360 * i % x == 0:
        print(360 * i // x)
        break
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();

        for (int i = 1; i < 100000; i++) {
            if (360 * i % x == 0) {
                System.out.println(360 * i / x);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, then iterates from 1 to 100000 (which is the same as 10^5 in Python). If the product of 360 and the current number is divisible by the input integer, it prints the result of the division and breaks the loop.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
