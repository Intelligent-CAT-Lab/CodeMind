<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 4

Expected output:
5


```
import math
a,b = map(int,input().split())
print(a+b-(math.gcd(a,b))+1)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a + b - gcd(a, b) + 1);
    }

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates their sum and difference, and then subtracts the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers. The gcd is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. The result is then incremented by 1 and printed to the standard output.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
