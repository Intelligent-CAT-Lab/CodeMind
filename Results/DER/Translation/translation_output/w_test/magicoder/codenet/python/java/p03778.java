<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 2 6

Expected output:
1


```
w, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if abs(a-b) < w:
    print(0)
else:
    print(abs(a-b) - w)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int w = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (Math.abs(a - b) < w) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Math.abs(a - b) - w);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads three integers from the standard input (which is usually the console), and then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is less than `w`. If it is, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the absolute difference and `w`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
