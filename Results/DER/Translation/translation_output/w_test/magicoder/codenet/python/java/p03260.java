<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 1

Expected output:
Yes


```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print("Yes" if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0 else "No")

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (a % 2 != 0 && b % 2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
