@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
6 2 4

Expected output:
2


```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02584 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        long x = Long.parseLong(scan.next());
        long k = Long.parseLong(scan.next());
        long d = Long.parseLong(scan.next());
        scan.close();

        long ans = 0;
        long absX = Math.abs(x);
        if (absX / d >= k) {
            ans = absX - k * d;
        } else {
            long sho = absX / d;
            long amari = absX % d;
            if ((k - sho) % 2 == 0) {
                ans = amari;
            } else {
                ans = d - amari;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

```

@@ Response
```python
x, k, d = map(int, input().split())
x = abs(x)

if x // d >= k:
    print(x - k * d)
else:
    sho = x // d
    amari = x % d
    if (k - sho) % 2 == 0:
        print(amari)
    else:
        print(d - amari)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the input, calculates the absolute value of the first integer, and then checks if the absolute value of the first integer divided by the third integer is greater than or equal to the second integer. If it is, it subtracts the product of the second and third integers from the absolute value of the first integer and prints the result. If it's not, it calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of the absolute value of the first integer by the third integer, and then checks if the difference between the second integer and the quotient is even. If it is, it prints the remainder. If it's not, it prints the difference between the third integer and the remainder.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
