@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 7 9 3

Expected output:
Yes


```
import java.util.Scanner;
public class p03351{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int ab = Math.abs(a-b);
        int ac = Math.abs(a-c);
        int bc = Math.abs(b-c);
        if(ac <= d || (ab <= d && bc <= d)){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

@@ Response
```python
import sys

def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    ab = abs(a - b)
    ac = abs(a - c)
    bc = abs(b - c)
    if ac <= d or (ab <= d and bc <= d):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads four integers from the standard input, calculates the absolute differences between the first two, the first two, and the last two, and checks if either of these differences is less than or equal to `d`. If it is, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
