<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4

Expected output:
128


```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p00330 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int W = scan.nextInt();
        
       
        
        
        System.out.println(W*32);
        
    }
}


```

@@ Response
```python

W = int(input())

print(W*32)

```

The provided Java code is a simple program that takes an integer input from the user and then prints the result of multiplying that integer by 32. The equivalent Python code is a simple program that does the same thing.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
