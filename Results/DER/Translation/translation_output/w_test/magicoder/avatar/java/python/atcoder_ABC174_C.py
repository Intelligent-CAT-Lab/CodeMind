This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It first calculates the number of digits in the number 7 that are needed to be multiplied by 10 to get a number that is greater than or equal to the input number. Then it calculates the number of digits in the number 7 that are needed to be multiplied by 10 to get a number that is divisible by the input number. If the number is not divisible by the input number, it keeps adding the digits to the number 7 until it becomes divisible by the input number. If the number is already in the set, it means that the number is repeating, so it returns -1.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
