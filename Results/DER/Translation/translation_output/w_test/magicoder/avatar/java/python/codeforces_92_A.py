    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    i = 1

    while k - req >= 0:

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input, and then it enters a loop where it subtracts `req` from `k` until `k - req` is less than 0. The `req` is updated in each iteration of the loop. The loop ends when `k - req` is less than 0. Finally, it prints the value of `k`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
