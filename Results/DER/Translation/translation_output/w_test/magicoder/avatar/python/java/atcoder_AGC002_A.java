<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
-1000000000 -1

Expected output:
Positive


```
a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
if a <= 0 and 0 <= b :
    print ( " Zero " )
elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 :
    print ( " Negative " )
else :
    print ( " Positive " )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a <= 0 && 0 <= b) {
            System.out.println("Zero");
        } else if (a < 0 && Math.min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Negative");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Positive");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads two integers from the standard input, and then checks the conditions as in the Python code. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the standard input. The `Math.min` function is used to find the minimum of two numbers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
