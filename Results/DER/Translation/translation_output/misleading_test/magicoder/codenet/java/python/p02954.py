Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def solve(S):
    N = len(S)
    ans = [0]*N
    curIndex = 0
    while curIndex < N:
        numLeft = 0
        numRight = 0
        while curIndex < N and S[curIndex]=='R':
            numRight += 1
            curIndex += 1
        R = curIndex - 1
        while curIndex < N and S[curIndex]=='L':
            numLeft += 1
            curIndex += 1
        left = numLeft
        right = numRight
        if (left+right)%2==0:
            left = (left+right)//2
            right = (left+right)//2
        else:
            if right%2==1:
                right = (left+right)//2
                left = (left+right) - right
            else:
                left = (left+right)//2
                right = (left+right) - left
        ans[R] = left
        ans[R+1] = right
    return ans

S = input()
print(*solve(S))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the input, and then it uses a while loop to iterate over the string. For each 'R' or 'L' sequence, it calculates the number of 'L's and 'R's, and then it calculates the number of children to be moved to the left and right. It then assigns these numbers to the corresponding positions in the answer array. Finally, it prints the answer array.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
