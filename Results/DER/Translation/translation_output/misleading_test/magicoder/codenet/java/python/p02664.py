@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
PD?D??P

Expected output:
PDPDP1DP

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02664 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @SuppressWarnings("resource")
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] c = sc.next().toCharArray();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < c.length ; i++) {
            if (c[i] == 'D' ||c[i]  ==  '?') {
                count++;
                c[i] = 'D';
            }
            System.out.print(c[i]);
        }
        System.out.print("\n");

    }

}
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def replace_and_count(s):
    count = 0
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char == 'D' or char == '?':
            count += 1
            result.append('D')
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result), count

s = input()
s, count = replace_and_count(s)
print(s + str(count))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, replaces 'D' and '?' with 'D', and counts the number of replacements. It then prints the modified string followed by the count.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
