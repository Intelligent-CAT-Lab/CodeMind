<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4

Expected output:
37

```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p00330 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int W = scan.nextInt();
        
       
        
        
        System.out.println(W*32);
        
    }
}


```

@@ Response
```python
# Python code

W = int(input())

print(W*32)
```

In this Python code, we are taking the input from the user and then printing the result of the multiplication of the input by 32. The `input()` function in Python is equivalent to `nextInt()` in Java.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
