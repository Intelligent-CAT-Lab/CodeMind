@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
takahashi

Expected output:
taXk

```
import java.util.*;
 
public class p02645 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String s = sc.next();
        
        System.out.println(s.substring(0,3));
   }
}

```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
s = input()
print(s[:3])
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, and then prints the first three characters of the string.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
