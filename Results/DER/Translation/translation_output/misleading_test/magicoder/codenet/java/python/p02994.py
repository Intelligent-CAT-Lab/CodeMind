@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
5 2

Expected output:
-35

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02994 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int l = scanner.nextInt();

        List<Integer> diff = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n+1; i++) {
          int value = l+i-1;
          if(value < 0) {
            value = value * -1;
          }
          diff.add(value);
          }
        
        Integer removeK = diff.indexOf(Collections.min(diff)) + 1;
        
        
        System.out.println(n*l + n*(n+1)/2 - n - (l+ removeK -1));
    }
}
```

@@ Response
```python
import sys

def main():
    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    diff = [abs(l + i - 1) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    removeK = diff.index(min(diff)) + 1

    print(n * l + n * (n + 1) // 2 - n - (l + removeK - 1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates the differences between the integers and the numbers from 1 to n, and then finds the smallest difference and its corresponding number. Finally, it calculates and prints the result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
