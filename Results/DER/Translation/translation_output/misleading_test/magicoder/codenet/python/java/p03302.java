<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 11

Expected output:
+

```
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a+b == 15:
    print('+')
elif a*b == 15:
    print('*')
else:
    print('x')
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (a + b == 15) {
            System.out.println('+');
        } else if (a * b == 15) {
            System.out.println('*');
        } else {
            System.out.println('x');
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, checks if their sum or product is 15, and prints '+' if the sum is 15, '*' if the product is 15, and 'x' otherwise.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
