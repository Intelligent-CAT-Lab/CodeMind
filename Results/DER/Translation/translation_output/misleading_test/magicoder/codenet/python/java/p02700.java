@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
10 9 10 10

Expected output:
No

```
A,B,C,D = map(int,input().split())
while A>0 and C>0:
    C -= B
    if C<=0:
        print("Yes")
        break
    A -= D
    if A<=0:
        print("No")
        break
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();
        int D = scanner.nextInt();

        while (A > 0 && C > 0) {
            C -= B;
            if (C <= 0) {
                System.out.println("Yes");
                break;
            }
            A -= D;
            if (A <= 0) {
                System.out.println("No");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads four integers from the standard input (which is usually the console), and then it simulates the Python code's behavior. It continues to decrease the value of `C` by `B` and `A` by `D` until `C` becomes less than or equal to zero, in which case it prints "Yes" and breaks the loop. If `A` becomes less than or equal to zero, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
