<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
AIZU

Expected output:
-9

```
S = input()

alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
Now = 0
ans = 0
for s in S:
    Next = alpha.find(s)
    # print(s, Now, Next)

    if(Now < Next):
        pass
    else:
        ans += 1
    Now = Next
print(ans)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();

        String alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int Now = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            char s = S.charAt(i);
            int Next = alpha.indexOf(s);

            if (Now < Next) {
                Now = Next;
            } else {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it finds its position in the alphabet string and checks if the current position is less than the position of the character. If it is, it updates the current position to the position of the character. If it's not, it increments the answer. Finally, it prints the answer.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
