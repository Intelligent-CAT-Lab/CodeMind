<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2 3 3

Expected output:
1 76

```
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
if a <= k:
    k -= a
    a = 0
else:
    print(a - k, b)
    exit()
print(0, max(b - k, 0))

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (a <= k) {
            k -= a;
            a = 0;
        } else {
            System.out.println(a - k + " " + b);
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(a + " " + Math.max(b - k, 0));
    }
}
```

This Java code reads three integers from the standard input (which is usually the console), and then performs the same operations as the Python code. It uses the `Scanner` class to read the input, and the `Math.max` function to ensure that the second number (`b`) does not go below zero.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
