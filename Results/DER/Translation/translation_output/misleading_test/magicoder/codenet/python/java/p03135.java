<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
8 3

Expected output:
92.98921496973458

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import math
from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
from heapq import heappush, heappop,heappushpop
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

t,x = LI()
print(t/x)
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Java code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt();
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((double) t / x);
    }
}
```

This Java code reads two integers from the standard input (System.in), calculates the division of the first integer by the second one, and then prints the result. The division is performed as a double to ensure that the result is a floating-point number.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
