<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 1 4

Expected output:
-35

```
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if c<=a+b+1:
    print(b+c)
else:
    print(a+2*b+1)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (c <= a + b + 1) {
            System.out.println(b + c);
        } else {
            System.out.println(a + 2 * b + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

You can test this code with the following test input:

```
3 1 4
```

And it should output:

```
