<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1 + 2

Expected output:
-70

```
A,s,B = input().split()
A = int(A)
B = int(B)
if s == '+':
    print(A+B)
elif s == '-':
    print(A-B)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] parts = input.split(" ");
        int A = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int B = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
        String s = parts[1];
        if (s.equals("+")) {
            System.out.println(A + B);
        } else if (s.equals("-")) {
            System.out.println(A - B);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts (A, operator, B), converts the first part to an integer, and then performs the operation indicated by the operator on the second and third parts. The result is then printed to the console.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
