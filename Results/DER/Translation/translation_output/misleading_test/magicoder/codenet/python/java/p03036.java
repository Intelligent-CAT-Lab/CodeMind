<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2 10 20

Expected output:
73
109
41
121
283
626
1346
2589
5137
10261

```
r,d,x = (int(i) for i in input().split())

for i in range(1,11):
    x = r*x-d
    print(x)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int x = scanner.nextInt();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            x = r * x - d;
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads three integers from the standard input (console), and then performs the same operation as the Python code. It prints the result of the operation 10 times.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
