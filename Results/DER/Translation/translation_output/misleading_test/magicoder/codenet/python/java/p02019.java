<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
6 3 2 1

Expected output:
29

```
n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print(n-(c+a-c+b-c))

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int result = n - (c + a - c + b - c);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

You can test this code with the following test input:

```
