<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 4 9 0

Expected output:
-6.249540170011613

```
A,B,H,M = list(map(int,input().split()))

import math

l = H*360/12 + M*30/60
s = M*360/60
ang = abs(l-s)
c = A**2 + B**2 -2*B*A*math.cos(math.radians(ang))
print(math.sqrt(c))
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int H = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();

        double l = H*360.0/12 + M*30.0/60;
        double s = M*360.0/60;
        double ang = Math.abs(l-s);
        double c = Math.pow(A, 2) + Math.pow(B, 2) - 2*B*A*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(ang));
        System.out.println(Math.sqrt(c));
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads four integers from the standard input, calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands, and then calculates the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the two other sides. The result is printed to the standard output.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
