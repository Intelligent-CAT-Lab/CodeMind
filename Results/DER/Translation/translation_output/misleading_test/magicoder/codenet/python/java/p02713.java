<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
20

```
from math import gcd
K = int(input())
ans = 0

for a in range(1, K+1):
    for b in range(1, K+1):
        for c in range(1, K+1):
            ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c)

print(ans)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;

        for (int a = 1; a <= K; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= K; b++) {
                for (int c = 1; c <= K; c++) {
                    ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c);
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer `K` from the standard input, then calculates the sum of the greatest common divisors (gcd) of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all between 1 and `K`. The `gcd` method is a helper method that calculates the gcd of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
