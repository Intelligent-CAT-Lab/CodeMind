This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the standard input, checks if the XOR of the two integers has an even number of set bits, and if it does, it prints "NO". If it doesn't, it prints "YES" and then prints the result of the function `f`. The function `f` is a recursive function that generates a list of integers based on the input integers and the number of bits set in the XOR of the two integers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
