```
N,A,B=map(int,input().split())

print(min(A*N,B))
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println(Math.min(A * N, B));
