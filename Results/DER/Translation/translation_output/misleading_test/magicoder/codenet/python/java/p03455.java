<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 4

Expected output:
Even

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
c = a * b
if c % 2 == 1:
    print('Odd')
else:
    print('Even')
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = a * b;
        if (c % 2 == 1) {
            System.out.println("Odd");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Even");
        }
    }
