<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
64

Expected output:
22.04590006873798

```
N = int ( input ( ) )
if N % 2 == 0 :
    print ( 0.5 )
else :
    print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (N % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(0.5);
        } else {
            System.out.println((N + 1) / (double) N / 2);
        }
    }
}
```

You can test this code with the following test input:

```
64
```

And it should output:
