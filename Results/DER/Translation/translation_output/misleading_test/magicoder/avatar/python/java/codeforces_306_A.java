<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
87 34

Expected output:
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3

```
n , m = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
q = n // m
r = n % m
a = [ q ] * m
for i in range ( r ) :
    a [ i ] += 1
for i in range ( m ) :
    print ( a [ i ] , end = ' â ' )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int q = n / m;
        int r = n % m;
        int[] a = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            a[i] = q;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            a[i] += 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of the first integer by the second, and then fills an array with the quotient and increments the first `r` elements by 1. Finally, it prints the elements of the array separated by a space.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
