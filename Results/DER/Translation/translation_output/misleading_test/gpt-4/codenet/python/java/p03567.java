Certainly! Below is the Java equivalent of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ACPresenceChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String s = scanner.nextLine();

        if (s.contains("AC")) {
            System.out.println("&*s");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In this Java code, `Scanner` is used to read the input from the user, and the string method `contains` is used to check if the string contains "AC". If it does, we print "&*s", otherwise, "No".

Please note that in the provided Python code, "Yes" is printed if "AC" is found, and "No" if not. However, your expected output is "&*s", so I've used that in the Java output to match your expected output text. If this was not your intention and you want the Java code to output "Yes" instead, you can simply replace "&*s" with "Yes" in the `System.out.println()` call.
