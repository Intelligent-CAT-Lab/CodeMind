Here is the equivalent Java code that performs the same operation as the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PowerWithMod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int mod = 1000000007;

        System.out.println(modularExponentiation(m, n, mod));
    }

    // Function to perform modular exponentiation
    private static long modularExponentiation(int base, int exponent, int modulus) {
        long result = 1;
        long b = base % modulus;

        while (exponent > 0) {
            if ((exponent & 1) != 0) {
                result = (result * b) % modulus;
            }
            exponent >>= 1;
            b = (b * b) % modulus;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

This Java code inputs two integers `m` and `n`, which represents the base and exponent respectively. Then, it calculates the result of `m^n` modulo `10^9+7`, using the `modularExponentiation` method which efficiently calculates the power with mod using the square-and-multiply method. Finally, the code prints out the result.

To test this code with the input mentioned (`2 3`), the following sequence of events will occur: 
- The user provides `2 3` as the input
- The program calculates `2^3 mod (10^9 + 7)`, which equals `8`
- The result `8` will be printed to the console

It seems like there might be a discrepancy between the sample test case output (`77`) and the expected output from the code which is `8` for the input `2 3`. Please make sure that the test case is accurate, or adjust the test case accordingly if the expected output was indeed meant to be `8`.
