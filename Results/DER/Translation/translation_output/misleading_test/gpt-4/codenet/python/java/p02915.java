Certainly! The following Java code snippet performs the equivalent operation as the provided Python script, which is reading a number from standard input and printing its cube:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CubeCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while(scanner.hasNextInt()) {  
            int n = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.println((int) Math.pow(n, 3));
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

The Java version should be run in an environment where input can be provided through the standard input just like the Python script.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, you'd typically want to add some user interaction and maybe some error handling to let the user know when their input is not valid or if they should enter a number. The provided test case won't directly work in this code because the Java program expects an interactive terminal input, but you could simulate the test with:

```
echo 2 | java CubeCalculator
```

This command would pipe the input "2" into the Java program, which should then output -92 (according to your expected output). However, please note that the cube of 2 is actually 8, so if -92 is the actual expected output, then there is an error in the test case expectation. Assuming the expectation was correct and the intention was to calculate the cube of the number, the output would be 8. If the input should indeed result in -92, the Python code and thus the Java code are not doing what is expected based on the provided test case.
