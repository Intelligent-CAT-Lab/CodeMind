Certainly! Here is the Java translation of the provided Python code, including a sample test case as if you've given an input of "CODEFESTIVAL".

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();

        System.out.println(s.substring(0, 4) + " " + s.substring(4) + " w");
    }
}
```

In case the test case was to be hardcoded into the program instead of accepting user input, it would look something like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "CODEFESTIVAL";
        System.out.println(s.substring(0, 4) + " " + s.substring(4) + " w");
    }
}
```

For both pieces of code, if you input "CODEFESTIVAL", the output, as expected, would be:

```
CODE FESTIVAL w
```
