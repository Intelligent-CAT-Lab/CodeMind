Below is the translated Java code from the provided Python code. The Java code reads a string from the user input, executes the dynamic programming logic to determine whether the input represents "Cat" or "Rabbit" according to the logic of "meow" sequences, and then outputs the result.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CatOrRabbit {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();
        int L = S.length();
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[L + 1][L + 1];

        // Initial state where left == right
        for (int i = 0; i <= L; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = true;
        }

        // Main dynamic programming loop
        for (int w = 3; w <= L; w += 3) {
            for (int left = 0; left <= L - w; left++) {
                int right = left + w;
                if (S.charAt(left) != 'm' || S.charAt(right - 1) != 'w') {
                    continue;
                }
                for (int mid = left + 1; mid < right; mid++) {
                    if (S.charAt(mid) == 'e' && dp[left + 1][mid] && dp[mid + 1][right - 1]) {
                        dp[left][right] = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(dp[0][L] ? "Cat" : "Rabbit");
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

To test this Java class, you would execute it by running the program and inputting a test case string, such as "mmemewwemeww"; the expected output would be "CatO". To keep the code concise, I've omitted a few niceties such as input validation and error handling, which you might want to include in a production environment.
