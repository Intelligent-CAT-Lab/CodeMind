Below is the translated Java code from the provided Python code. Please note that in Java, we define the size of the array at the beginning and cannot dynamically grow it as in Python, so we need to be accurate with the array dimensions. Additionally, we use scanner for input and System.out.printf for output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DynamicProgramming {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int mod = 998244353;
        long[][] dp = new long[c + 2][d + 2];
        dp[a][b] = 1;

        for (int i = a; i <= c; i++) {
            for (int j = b; j <= d; j++) {
                dp[i][j] %= mod;
                dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j] * j;
                dp[i][j + 1] += dp[i][j] * i;
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] -= dp[i][j] * i * j;

                // Ensuring the values are within the modulus after each operation
                dp[i + 1][j] = ((dp[i + 1][j] % mod) + mod) % mod;
                dp[i][j + 1] = ((dp[i][j + 1] % mod) + mod) % mod;
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] = ((dp[i + 1][j + 1] % mod) + mod) % mod;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(dp[c][d]);
    }
}
```

Make sure to compile and run this Java program with the provided test input to validate that it works as expected and produces the output `59`. The test input can be provided through standard input (for example, through the console when running the program).
