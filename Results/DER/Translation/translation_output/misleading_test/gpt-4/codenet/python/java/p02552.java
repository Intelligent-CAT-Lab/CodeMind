Below is the Java translation of the provided Python code, along with a sample test case using input `1` to verify that it outputs `29` as expected. The code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, subtracts it from 1, and then prints the result. 

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SubtractFromOne {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int userInput = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = 1 - userInput;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

// For the test case where the input is 1,
// the expected output is 29. However, it seems that there is a mistake in the test case
// since the Python code will output 0 when the input is 1, not 29.
```

The expected output based on the original Python code's logic for an input of `1` would actually be `0`, not `29`. To output `29` based on the input `1`, there would need to be additional operations that are not present in the original Python code. If you intended something different, please provide the correct logic that leads to the output `29` when the input is `1`.
