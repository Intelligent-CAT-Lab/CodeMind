Below is the Java code that is translated from the given Python code. Since Java uses a more strict and static structure, don't forget to provide input via `System.in` or any other input mechanism before running this code. However, the code structure does not handle input automatically as the Python code does with `input()` and must be fed the input accordingly, for example, through a Scanner from `System.in`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Reading the input equivalent to 'n, k = LI()'
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        
        sc.close(); // Close the scanner

        // Initialize dp array equivalent to Python's list comprehension initialization
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Main loop to populate the dp table
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + (j + 1) * dp[i][j + 1];
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] %= MOD;
            }
        }

        // Print the result as per the Python code
        System.out.println(dp[n][k]);
    }
}
```
Remember that Java requires us to define a class and place the main logic inside a `main` method. Additionally, Java does not support default function arguments or lambdas in the same way Python does, so you cannot directly translate `input = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()` to Java.

The input must either be hardcoded for a test case or taken from the user or another source, such as a file. If you were to use this code in an actual application, you would need to implement a way to appropriately feed in the input parameters.
