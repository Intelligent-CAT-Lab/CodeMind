Here is the equivalent Java code for the provided Python code, which calculates the cube of one-third of the input value:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CubeCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the input integer
        int L = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate one-third of the input value
        double hen = (double) L / 3;

        // Print the cube of 'hen'
        System.out.println(Math.pow(hen, 3));

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

To run the test case in Java, you would need to input `3` and then the program will output `-29.561930693928545`. However, this specific output is not correct, as the cube of the one-third of 3 is a positive value. The correct output should be `1.0`. The value of `hen` would be `1.0`, and `hen**3` (cube of `hen`) would also be `1.0`. Make sure the provided Python code and expected output align properly before performing the conversion to Java.
