Here's the equivalent Java code of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = (x - 30) / 2;
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}
```

This Java program reads an integer from the standard input, computes the value of `y` as per the given logic, and then prints it to the standard output.
