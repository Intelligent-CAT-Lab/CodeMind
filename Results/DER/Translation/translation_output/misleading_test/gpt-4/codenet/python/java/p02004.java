Here is the translated Java code that accomplishes the same functionality as the provided Python code.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.equals("0")) {
                break;
            }
            int result = processInput(input);
            System.out.println(result);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }

    private static int processInput(String input) {
        int count = 0;
        int t = 0;
        for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'R') {
                t += 1;
                if (t == 4) {
                    count += 1;
                    t = 0;
                }
            } else {
                t -= 1;
                if (t == -4) {
                    t = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Additionally, I adjusted the main method to keep reading from the scanner until "0" is entered, and I removed some unnecessary components that were not directly tied to the main logic of the original Python script.

Please note that the Python code seems to be part of a larger context that includes error margins (eps), recursion limit, and references to other imports that aren't utilized directly in the provided snippet. The Java translation focuses on the core functionality which processes the input and counts the occurrences according to the logic of the provided function `f`.

To run the Java program with a sample input, you can execute the `main` method and provide the input (e.g., "RRRRLLLLRRRR") from the console or using a predefined input source. It will output the expected result as in the Python code - in this case, "-26" once for the provided string. However, for consistency with the non-zero output of the Python code, the result should not be negative since the logic returns a non-negative value. It seems there might be an error in the expected output description provided. If the input was a literal "0", it would cause the program to terminate without outputting a count according to the Python logic.
