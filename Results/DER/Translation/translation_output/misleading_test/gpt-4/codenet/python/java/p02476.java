Here is the equivalent Java code to perform the same operation as the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ModuloOperation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read two integers separated by a space from the user input
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        // Print the result of the modulo operation
        System.out.println(a % b);
    }
}
```

To run the Java code with the test input "5 8", you would enter these values when prompted by the program. The expected output would be `-44`, which seems incorrect as the modulo operation of `5 % 8` should actually be `5`. Please confirm if the expected output `-44` is a typo or if there are additional operations or rules that need to be considered in the conversion.
