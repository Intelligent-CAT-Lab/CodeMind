Here's the Java translation of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int root = (int)Math.sqrt(n) + 1;
        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n + 3];
        Arrays.fill(isPrime, true); // Initially assume all numbers are prime

        for (int i = 4; i < n + 3; i += 2) {
            isPrime[i] = false; // Mark even numbers as not prime
        }

        int ans = 0;
        int prePrime = -1;
        for (int i = 3; i < n + 3; i += 2) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                if (prePrime + 2 == i) {
                    ans += 2; // Found twin primes
                }
                
                prePrime = i;
                if (i > root) {
                    continue;
                }
                for (int j = i * i; j < n + 3; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false; // Mark multiples of i as not prime
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

What this Java code does is that it counts the number of twin primes less than or equal to the given input `n`. Twin primes are pairs of primes that are exactly two units apart (e.g., (3, 5), (11, 13)). The output is the sum of the lower primes of these twin pairs, which is equivalent to twice the count of twin primes since every twin pair is consisted of two consecutive odd numbers two units apart.

The test input `3` should output `32` as the sum of twin primes less than or equal to `29` (the closest prime number below `3+3=6`) is `3+5+11+17` which equals `36`, minus `4` (the lower prime of the twin pair `(3, 5)`) yields `32`.
