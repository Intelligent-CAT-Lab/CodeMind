Here is the Python code translated into Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();
        
        int c = a * b;
        if (c % 2 == 1) {
            System.out.println("Odd");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Even");
        }
    }
}
```

You can compile and run this Java program, passing the test input "3 4" when prompted, and you should expect to see "Even" as the output, which matches the expected output for the provided test case.
