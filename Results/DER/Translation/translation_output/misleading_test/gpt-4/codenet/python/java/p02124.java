Here's your translated Python code to Java, enclosed within the `java` context as you requested:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        String result = "ai1333" + "3".repeat(input / 100);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Note that the `repeat` method is available since Java 11. This code expects an integer input from `System.in`, then it constructs the string just like in your Python example and prints it to the console.

If you're using a version of Java older than Java 11, you could alternatively replace the `repeat` method with a loop to append the character `'3'` the required number of times:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("ai1333");
        for(int i = 0; i < input / 100; i++) {
            result.append("3");
        }
        System.out.println(result.toString());
    }
}
```

Please note that you will also need to compile and execute this Java program in an environment with a compilation and Java Runtime Environment installed.
