Here's the translation of the given Python code to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n + 1) * n / 2);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

The Java code follows similar logic but uses the `Scanner` class for input and the `System.out.println` method to print the result. The calculation is directly translated as Java also follows the same arithmetic precedence rules as Python.
