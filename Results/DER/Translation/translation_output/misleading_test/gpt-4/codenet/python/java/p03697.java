Below is the Java translation of the provided Python code with a `main` method to handle the test case input. The Java code expects the input in the format "6 3" passed as command-line arguments.

```java
public class SumOrError {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 2) {
            System.out.println("Please provide two numbers separated by a space.");
            return;
        }

        try {
            int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
            int sum = a + b;

            if (sum >= 10) {
                System.out.println("error");
            } else {
                System.out.println(sum);
            }
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Both inputs must be valid integers.");
        }
    }
}
```

To compile and run this Java program, you would need to use the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE) and provide the input as arguments. For example:

```sh
javac SumOrError.java
java SumOrError 6 3
```

This should give you the expected output:
```
28
``` 

However, keep in mind that Java handles input differently than Python; the sample usage above assumes the inputs are being passed as command-line arguments when running the program. If you want to read input from the user, you would need to use a `Scanner` or similar input mechanism in Java.
