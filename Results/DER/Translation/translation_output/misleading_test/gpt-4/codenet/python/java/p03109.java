Below is the Java translation of the provided Python code along with a possible approach to handle user input as the test input. In Java, input handling is commonly done using a `Scanner` for console input.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] parts = input.split("/");
        
        int A = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int B = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        int C = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
        
        if (A <= 2018) {
            System.out.println("Heisei");
        } else if (A == 2019 && B <= 4 && C <= 30) {
            System.out.println("Heisei");
        } else {
            System.out.println("TBD");
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Please note that the `Scanner` class needs to be imported, and it's used to read a line input from the user, which is split based on the "/" delimiter. After parsing each part into integers, the program continues with the same conditional logic as the original Python code.

This code is placed into a `Main` class, which would be the typical way to organize code in a Java program. For practical use, you would have to compile this with `javac` and then execute the compiled class file with the `java` command, providing the input as required.

If you are expected to provide unit testing or some form of automated testing, you would need to adapt the input/output handling to work with a testing framework such as JUnit. The scanner part would be replaced by method arguments to enable parameterized testing.
