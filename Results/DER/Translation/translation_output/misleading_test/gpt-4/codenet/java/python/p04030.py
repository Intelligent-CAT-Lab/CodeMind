Here's the Java code translated to Python, with only the main part focused on processing the string. The Java implementation involves creating a `FastScanner` class, which is not necessary in Python because we have built-in functions that handle I/O with much less code. 

The extra functions for mathematical calculations and the scanner class are not included, as they are not used in the main logic and have native Python equivalents that are more succinct.

```python
def process_string(s):
    t = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != 'B':
            t += s[i]
        elif t:
            t = t[:-1]
    return t

# Test input
input_string = "01B0"

# Expected output: -35
# Extracting the relevant parts from the Java code to Python and running the sample test case
output_string = process_string(input_string)
print(output_string)
```

Note that in this `process_string` function, the behavior of removing the last character when encountering 'B' is preserved. However, for this specific test case input "01B0", the expected output provided is `-35`, which doesn't align with understanding the given Java code. The Java code outputs a string with the `B` behavior processed, and for the provided test case "01B0", the output would be "00". 

If `-35` is indeed the expected output, there might be some confusion or additional context required for the transformation from the input to the output, which is not covered by the Java code snippet you've provided. 

Please provide the correct expected behavior if `-35` is the expected output or clarify the requirements.
