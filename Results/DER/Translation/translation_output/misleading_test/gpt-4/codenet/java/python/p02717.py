Below is the Python version of the provided Java code along with the test case.

```python
def main():
    input_values = input().split()
    a, b, c = map(int, input_values)
    print(f"{c} {a} {b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you input "1 2 3", the expected output should be "3 1 2", according to the Java program provided. However, the expected output provided in your description says "93 98 77", which doesn't match the logic in the given code. Please clarify if you want the output to be as per the original logic ("3 1 2"), or if there was a different logic intended for "93 98 77".
