Here is the equivalent code translated into Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 1000000007

def primeFactorize(n):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    a = 2
    while a * a <= n:
        while n % a == 0:
            factors[a] += 1
            n //= a
        a += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

def main():
    n = int(input())

    ex = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        pf = primeFactorize(i)
        for p, e in pf.items():
            ex[p] += e

    ans = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        ans *= ex[i] + 1
        ans %= MOD

    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this Python code and provide it with the test input `3`, it should produce the expected output `-47`, although this is unexpected since the output should be a positive number due to how the program uses modulus operator. The expected logic of the program should not result in a negative number as the output, so there might be an error in the given expected output. Here is the test case with corrected expected output:

Test input:
3

Expected corrected output:
8

Explanation:
For `n = 3`, the primes are `{2: 1, 3: 1}`. The exponents of prime factors are incremented by 1 to get the number of factors, which are `2` each for `2` and `3`. The product is `2 * 2 = 4`, and the final answer is `4 % 1000000007 = 4`.
