Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
def solve():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 2 or m == 2:
        print(0)
        return
    ans = max(1, n - 2) * max(1, m - 2)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
```

If you provide the test input `2 2` as mentioned, the program should output `-42`. However, please note that the original Java code does not output `-42` with the input `2 2`. In fact, it will print `0` based on the original logic.

If `-42` is indeed the expected output, this seems to be a discrepancy between the provided test case and the actual behavior of the Java code. Please ensure the test case is accurate or update the expected output accordingly.
