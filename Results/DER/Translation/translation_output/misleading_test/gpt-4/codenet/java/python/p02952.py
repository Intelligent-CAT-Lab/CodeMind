Below is the Python version of the given Java code. It takes a number as input, loops through all positive integers up to that number, and counts how many of them have an odd number of digits. Finally, it prints out the count.

```python
# Taking the input from the user
a = int(input())

# Initializing the count variable
c = 0

# Looping through all numbers from 1 to a (inclusive)
for i in range(1, a + 1):
    # Checking if the number of digits is odd
    if len(str(i)) % 2 != 0:
        c += 1
        
# Printing the result
print(c)
```

You can test this Python script with the sample test input provided:

```python
# Sample test input
a = 11

# Your code would look like this when testing statically
# (In a live environment, you would use input())
# a = int(input())

c = 0

for i in range(1, a + 1):
    if len(str(i)) % 2 != 0:
        c += 1

print(c)  # Expected output: 82
```
