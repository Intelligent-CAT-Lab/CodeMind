Below is the translated Python code:

```python
def solve(k):
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    
    n = (k + 3) // 4 * 2
    
    ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            ret[i][j] = (0 if i % 2 == 0 else n) + (i + j) % n
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if ret[i][j] >= k:
                ret[i][j] = (ret[i][j] - n) % k
    
    print(n)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(ret[i][j] + 1, end=' ')
        print()

# The Java code reads input from command line arguments or standard input...
# For the purpose of this test, we'll just directly call solve with test input.
solve(2)
```

The Java code uses threads and other utility functions for input and debugging which are not translated into Python as it is not typically needed for executing standalone Python scripts. If the same level of input handling is required, you would need to create corresponding functions to handle input in Python, e.g., using `input()` or command-line arguments with `argparse`.

Please note that this Python code is designed to work in a Python environment, outside of any constraints such as multi-threading used in the Java version, and it omits some utility functions from the Java version that are used for reading input, formatting output, and debugging.
