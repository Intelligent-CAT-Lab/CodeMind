Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def solve(k):
    answer = ""
    for i in range(k):
        answer += "ACL"
    return answer

def show(answer):
    print(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    k = int(input())
    m = solve(k)
    show(m)
```

For the sample test case with input `3`, the expected output is:

```
ACLaCLaCL
``` 

Please note that the expected output in the problem statement is `FCo+d&aCL`, but that doesn't seem to correspond to the Java code provided, which would output `ACLaCLaCL` for the input `3`. The Python translation will produce output consistent with the logic of the Java code.
