Here's the translated Python code that reads two integers from standard input and prints `0` if the first is smaller than the second, or prints `10` otherwise:

```python
# Sample test input: 3 5
# Expected output: 0

# Read integers from input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Compare and print the result
if a < b:
    print(0)
else:
    print(10)
```

To test this with the provided input (`3 5`), you would run this Python code and enter `3 5` when prompted. The output would be `0`. However, the expected output in your request is `58`, which does not match the logic in the given Java code. If you meant the output to follow the logic in the Java code, then the expected output with the input `3 5` should be `0`, not `58`. If you actually want an output of `58`, the logic would need to be adjusted accordingly.
