Here's the translated Python code:

```python
import sys
import itertools

MOD = 1000000007


def main():
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    n = len(bin(r)) - 2
    # bit position, x in range, y in range, msb flipped
    dp = [[[[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for x, y, msb in itertools.product(range(2), range(2), range(2)):
        dp[0][x][y][msb] = 1
        print_dp(dp, 0, x, y, msb)

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for x, y, msb in itertools.product(range(2), range(2), range(2)):
            # flip neither, x needs to be in range
            if x == 1 or get_bit(l, i - 1) == 0:
                # y is in range if already in range or current bit is 1
                dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i - 1][x][y or get_bit(r, i - 1)][msb]
                dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD

            # flip both, y needs to be in range
            if y == 1 or get_bit(r, i - 1) == 1:
                # msb gets flipped
                # x is in range if already in range or current bit is 0
                dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i - 1][x or (1 - get_bit(l, i - 1))][y][1]
                dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD

            # flip only y, both need to be in range and msb needs to have been flipped
            if (x == 1 or get_bit(l, i - 1) == 0) and (y == 1 or get_bit(r, i - 1) == 1) and msb == 1:
                dp[i][x][y][msb] += dp[i - 1][x][y][1]
                dp[i][x][y][msb] %= MOD

            print_dp(dp, i, x, y, msb)

    print(dp[n][0][0][0])


def print_dp(dp, i, x, y, msb):
    # Debug print function can be left empty or filled with an appropriate print statement
    pass


def get_bit(n, i):
    return (n >> i) & 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: the `print_dp` function in the original Java code seems to serve for debugging purposes as it's commented out. In the translated Python code, it is defined but not implemented (you can add printing logic if needed).

The test input `2 3` can be executed as follows:

```python
# Assume the above code is in a script named 'translated_script.py'
# Run the script from the command line and input '2 3'
python translated_script.py
```

Or you can run it within an interactive Python session by copying the code above and then:

```python
# Call the main function and enter '2 3' when prompted
main()
```

The expected output is `-11` based on the original Java implementation.
