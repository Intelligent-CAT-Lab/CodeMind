Here's the Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
def main():
    ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60]
    i = int(input())
    print(ans[i])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can test the Python code with the provided test case as follows:

Test input:
```
1
```

Expected output:
```
46
```

Note: There seems to be a discrepancy between the provided test case and the code logic. According to the Java code, when the input is `1`, the output should be `1` as well, as per the `ans` array. If the expected output is truly `46` for the input `1`, there may be an error in either the test case or the Java code provided.
