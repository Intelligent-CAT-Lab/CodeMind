Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import math

def execute(number):
    r = int(math.sqrt(number))
    print(r * r)

def main():
    number = int(input())
    execute(number)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To run the test case with an input of `10` and get the expected output of `-7`, it seems there's either a mistake in the expected output or in the problem statement as the example provided does not produce `-7` for input `10`. The program actually takes the square root of the given number, truncates the decimal part, and then prints the square of that integer result. For input `10`, the square root is approximately `3.16`. Truncating the decimal gives `3`, and squaring `3` gives `9`, not `-7`.

Using the above Python code, when you input `10`, the output will be `9`. If the expected output should indeed be `-7`, then the code logic would need to be different from what's provided. Please clarify if the expected output is what you indeed want for the input `10`, so I can adjust the code accordingly.
