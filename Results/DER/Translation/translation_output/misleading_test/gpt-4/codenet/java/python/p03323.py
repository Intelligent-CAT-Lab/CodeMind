Here is the translated Python code:

```python
# Get input from the user
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Check the condition and print the result
if a <= 8 and b <= 8:
    print("Yay")
else:
    print(":(")
```

For your test input "5 4", you can run the above code snippet, and the expected output "Yay" should be printed to the console.
