Here's the translated Python code:

```python
# Read input from user
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the answer
ans = (A + B - 24) if (A + B) > 23 else (A + B)

# Print the answer
print(ans)
```

Here is how it works for the provided test case:

Test input: `9 12`

Expected output: `73`
