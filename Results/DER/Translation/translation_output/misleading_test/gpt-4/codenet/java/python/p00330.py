Below is the translated Python code from the given Java code:

```python
def main():
    W = int(input())
    print(W * 32)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this Python program with an input of 4, the expected output will be 37 (although the given Java code actually outputs 128). If the output 37 is required, it is likely a mistake in the original Java code or in the provided expected output, since 4 * 32 should indeed be 128. Please recheck the intended logic or the expected output.
