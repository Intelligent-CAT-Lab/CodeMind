Below is the translated Python code for the given Java code, enclosed within triple backticks as requested.

```python
import sys

def solve(s):
    l = len(s)
    if (l % 2 == 0) ^ (s[0] == s[-1]):
        print("Second")
    else:
        print("First")

def main():
    s = input().strip()
    solve(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The Python code performs the same functionality:

1. Reads a string from the standard input.
2. Checks if the length of the string is even or odd and if the first and last character of the string are the same.
3. Based on these conditions, it prints "Second" or "First".

You can use the following test input to validate the code:

```python
# Test input
s = "aba" 

# Expected output
solve(s) # should output "Second"
```
