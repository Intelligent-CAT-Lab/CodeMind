Here is the translated code from Java to Python. It reads a single character from the standard input, checks if the character is uppercase (between A-Z), and prints "A" if it is, or "a" if it's not.

```python
def main():
    str = input()
    print("A" if str.isupper() else "a")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you provide the test input 'B', this Python code should output 'A', as expected from the Java code you provided.
