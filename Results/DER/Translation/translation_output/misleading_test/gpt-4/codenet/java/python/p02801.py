Here is the equivalent Python code for your provided Java code snippet:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    c = s[0]
    out = chr(ord(c) + 1) if 'a' <= c <= 'y' else None
    if out is not None:
        print(out)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python function reads a single character from the input (as the original Java code does), and if the character is between 'a' and 'y', it increments the ASCII value by one to obtain the next alphabetical character, then prints it out. If the character is 'z' or outside the range 'a' to 'y', the variable `out` will be `None` and nothing will be printed. Notice that we don't need a `switch` statement in Python, as we can calculate the next character directly using `ord` and `chr` functions.
