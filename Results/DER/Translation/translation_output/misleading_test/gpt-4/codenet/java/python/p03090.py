The following Python code is a translation of the provided Java code:

```python
def solve(a, l):
    if a % 2 == 0:
        for i in range(1, a//2 + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, a//2 + 1):
                l.append(f"{i} {j}")
                l.append(f"{i} {a + 1 - j}")
                l.append(f"{a + 1 - i} {j}")
                l.append(f"{a + 1 - i} {a + 1 - j}")
    else:
        solve(a - 1, l)
        for i in range(1, a):
            l.append(f"{a} {i}")

def main():
    a = int(input())
    l = []
    solve(a, l)
    print(len(l))
    for str_ in l:
        print(str_)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dbg = True
    main()
```

A sample test case, you can copy and run the script and then input the test case:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dbg = True
    main()
```

You would then input `3` to achieve the expected result:

```
-97
*n+
P Z
```
Please note that the expected output in the prompt does not correlate with the given code so your actual output will indeed differ from this. The original Java code doesn't generate such output either. It appears to be some kind of placeholder or error in the prompt. The provided solution is a direct translation of the logic present in the Java code.
