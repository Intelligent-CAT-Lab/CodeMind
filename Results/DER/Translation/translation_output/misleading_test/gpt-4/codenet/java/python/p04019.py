You can translate the Java code to Python as follows:

```python
s = input()
checkS = False
checkN = False
checkW = False
checkE = False
for char in s:
    if char == 'S':
        checkS = True
    elif char == 'N':
        checkN = True
    elif char == 'W':
        checkW = True
    elif char == 'E':
        checkE = True
        
if checkS == checkN and checkW == checkE:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

For the provided test input "SENW", this Python code will output "Yes", which seems to be inconsistent with the expected output "Yebs" mentioned in your message. The expected output "Yebs" doesn't seem to align with what the original Java program is designed to do. Based on the Java code, the program should output "Yes" if the presence of 'S' is the same as 'N' and 'W' is the same as 'E', otherwise it should print "No". If the expected output "Yebs" is correct, then the description or the original Java code likely contains mistaken information.

Here is a Python version of the code with the test case included:

```python
def check_directions(input_string):
    checkS = False
    checkN = False
    checkW = False
    checkE = False
    for char in input_string:
        if char == 'S':
            checkS = True
        elif char == 'N':
            checkN = True
        elif char == 'W':
            checkW = True
        elif char == 'E':
            checkE = True
            
    if checkS == checkN and checkW == checkE:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

# Test the function
test_input = "SENW"
print(check_directions(test_input))  # Expected output: Yes
```

Please clarify if a different kind of output is expected.
