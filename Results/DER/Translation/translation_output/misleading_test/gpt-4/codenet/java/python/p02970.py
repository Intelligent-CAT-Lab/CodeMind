Here is the translated Python code that replicates the functionality of the given Java code:

```python
from math import ceil

# Read the input
N, D = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of areas covered by one guard
areas_covered = D * 2 + 1.0
ans = N / areas_covered

# Round up to the next integer
ans = ceil(ans)
print(ans)
```

When you run this Python code with the input you provided (`6 2`), the output will be `63`, assuming there was a typo in the expected output. The correct expected output should be `2`, since the answer represents the minimum number of guards needed to cover `N` areas when each guard covers `D*2+1` areas.
