Here's the translated python code based on the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input
n = int(input())

# Switch-case equivalent using if-elif-else in Python
if n == 0:
    print(1)
elif n == 1:
    print(2)
elif n == 2:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

However, the expected output provided for the test input 0 is '39', which does not match the output from the provided Java code. The Java code would print '1' for the input 0.

Assuming a typo in the expected output, the provided code should give the correct translation for the provided Java code if the expected output would be considered as '1'. If '39' was indeed the expected output, then there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the specifications of the problem.
