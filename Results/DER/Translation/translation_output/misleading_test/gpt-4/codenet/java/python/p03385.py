The Python code equivalent to the given Java code is as follows. This code checks if the input string contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Run the code below for the sample test case:

```python
def check_abc_presence(input_string):
    # Create a boolean list to mark the presence of 'a', 'b', and 'c'
    abc = [False, False, False]

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        if char == 'a':
            abc[0] = True
        if char == 'b':
            abc[1] = True
        if char == 'c':
            abc[2] = True

    # Check if all 'a', 'b', and 'c' were found
    is_OK = all(abc)

    # Return "Yes" if all found, otherwise "No"
    return "Yes" if is_OK else "No"

# Test input
test_input = "bac"

# Expected output: "Yes"
print(check_abc_presence(test_input))
```

Bear in mind that the expected output in the prompt is "Yews" which is presumably a typo in place of "Yes". The Python code above would output "Yes" instead.
