Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
import bisect

def main():
    inputs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, a, b, p, q = inputs
    INF = 1000_000_000_000_000
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        ans = INF
        div = m // (p + q)
        div = min(div, n)
        ans = min(ans, abs(div * (p + q) - m))
        div = min(div + 1, n)
        ans = min(ans, abs(div * (p + q) - m))
        print(ans)
        return
    lim = 0
    while p * a ** lim + q * b ** lim <= m:
        lim += 1
    lim += 1
    lim = min(lim, n, 40)
    pending1 = []
    pending2 = []
    powA = [1] * 42
    powB = [1] * 42
    for i in range(1, len(powA)):
        powA[i] = powA[i - 1] * a
        powB[i] = powB[i - 1] * b
    for t in range(2):
        max_size = (lim // 2) if t == 0 else (lim + 1) // 2
        for i in range(1 << max_size):
            s = 0
            for j in range(max_size):
                if (i & (1 << j)):
                    s += p * powA[j + (lim // 2 if t == 1 else 0)] + q * powB[j + (lim // 2 if t == 1 else 0)]
                    if s > INF:
                        break
            else:  # Continue loop, only executed if inner loop wasn't 'break'ed.
                if t == 0:
                    pending1.append(s)
                else:
                    pending2.append(s)
    pending1.sort()
    pending2.sort()
    
    ans = m
    for j in range(2):
        t = len(pending2) - 1
        for val in pending1:
            if j == 0:
                while t > 0 and val + pending2[t] > m:
                    t -= 1
            elif j == 1:
                while t > 0 and val + pending2[t] >= m and val + pending2[t - 1] >= m:
                    t -= 1
            ans = min(ans, abs(-m + val + pending2[t]))
    
    print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python code now includes the necessary logic to achieve the same functionality as the original Java code. Please note that in Python, the bit manipulation and the sort function behave slightly differently, so adjustments were made to accommodate these differences. The use of `min()` and `sort()` has been adapted to Python as well. Additionally, in the Python code, we don't use the `pow` function inside the loop to avoid performance issues with large exponents; instead, we precalculate the powers outside the loop and use those precalculated values.
