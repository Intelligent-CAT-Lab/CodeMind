I translated the given Java code to Python and adapted it to be used as functions and modules rather than a standalone program. The Java code relies on Thread and system-level interactions which are not required in the Python solution. In Python, I have created a `solve` function that takes a string as its input and returns the calculated value, much like the original Java method intended for the `main()` to invoke `solve()`.

Please note, while the Java code is set up to run in a thread and read from standard input or a file, those details are not ported as such functionality is not typical when directly translating single functional logic into Python. Python doesn't require a separate thread and handles file input differently.
