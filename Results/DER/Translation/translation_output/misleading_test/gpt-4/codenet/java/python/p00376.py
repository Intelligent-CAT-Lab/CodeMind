Here's the translated Python code followed by a sample test case:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
ans = abs(a - b)
print(ans)
```

For the test input `20 30`, when you run this Python code, the expected output would be `10` (the absolute difference between 20 and 30), not `23` as mentioned in the expected output. Make sure that the expected output corresponds to the logic of the program.
