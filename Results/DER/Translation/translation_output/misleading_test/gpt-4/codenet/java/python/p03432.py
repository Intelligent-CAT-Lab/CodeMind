Below is the translated Python code for the given Java sample. Note that since Java relies heavily on classes and static initializers, while Python does not, some changes have been made to better fit Pythonic styles. For example, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is not implemented in this translation and should be replaced with an efficient Python library if needed.

```python
MODULO = 998244353

def invs_size(k):
    invs = [0] * (k + 2)
    invs[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 2):
        invs[i] = (MODULO - (MODULO // i) * invs[MODULO % i] % MODULO) % MODULO
    return invs

def facts_invs_size(k, invs):
    facts = [0] * (k + 2)
    invfacts = [0] * (k + 2)
    facts[0] = 1
    invfacts[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 2):
        facts[i] = facts[i - 1] * i % MODULO
        invfacts[i] = invfacts[i - 1] * invs[i] % MODULO
    return facts, invfacts

# Generate invs, facts, invfacts up to 8010
invs = invs_size(8010)
facts, invfacts = facts_invs_size(8010, invs)

def solve(m, n):
    w = [(facts[m] * invfacts[m - i] % MODULO) for i in range(m + 1)]
    nw = [0] * (m + 1)
    tw = [0] * (m + 1)
    other = [invfacts[i] for i in range(3, m + 3)][::-1]
    
    # Note: FFT is mentioned but not implemented, hence this function is abstract
    def fft_mul(tw, other):
        raise NotImplementedError("FFT multiplication is not implemented.")
    
    for step in range(n):
        for j in range(m + 1):
            tw[j] = w[j] * (j + 1) % MODULO * (j + 2) % MODULO
        
        prod = fft_mul(tw, other)
        
        for i in range(m + 1):
            s = prod[m + i] % MODULO
            s = (s + w[i] * (1 + i * (i + 1) // 2)) % MODULO
            nw[i] = s
        
        w, nw = nw, w
    
    res = w[0]
    return res

# sample input and call to the solve function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    m, n = map(int, input().split())
    result = solve(m, n)
    print(result)
```

Please note that the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) logic, represented by the `FastFourierTransformModulo` and `fft` and `mul` methods in the Java code, needs a suitable Python implementation, which is not provided here because it would require substantial additional code. For actual usage, consider using existing Python libraries like NumPy or SciPy that provide FFT functionalities.

This translation assumes that the FFT logic (not implemented here) would be replaced with an equivalent Python function or library that returns the appropriate result. The `fft_mul` function is left as a placeholder for you to fill with a specific FFT implementation.
