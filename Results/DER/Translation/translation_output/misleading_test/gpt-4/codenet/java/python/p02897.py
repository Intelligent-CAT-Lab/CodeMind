```python
# Read input from user
n = float(input())

# Initialize counters
odd = 0
not_odd = 0

# Loop through integers from 1 to n
for i in range(1, int(n) + 1):
  if i % 2 == 0:
    not_odd += 1
  else:
    odd += 1

# Compute and print the result
print(odd / n)
```

To test the Python code with the provided test input, you would execute the code and enter `4` when prompted. The expected output should match the Java program's output:

```
-53.85961348061815
```

Please note that the output will not match the expected output given in your message, because the provided Java code calculates the ratio of odd numbers to `n` (which would be 0.5 for `n=4`), but there is no operation in the code that would result in `-53.85961348061815`.
