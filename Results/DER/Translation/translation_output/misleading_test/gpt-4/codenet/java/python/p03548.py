Below is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import sys
import math

# Fast input template
def get_ints(): 
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
def get_int(): 
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

class Solver:
    def read_int(self):
        return get_int()
    
    def read_ints(self, n):
        return [self.read_int() for _ in range(n)]
    
    def solve(self):
        x, y, z = get_ints()
        print((x - z) // (y + z))

def main():
    solver = Solver()
    solver.solve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that in Python, we typically don't have to write a separate class to parse input as we do in Java. The `sys.stdin` methods can be used directly to read from standard input. Python also does not have the same class structure as Java, so the solution can be more streamlined with functions rather than methods on a solver instance. 

However, to closely match the structure of the original code, I've encapsulated the solution in a `Solver` class with `solve()` as the main method, and replaced integer input readings with equivalent Python code utilizing `sys.stdin`.

Make sure to run this code with the standard input containing the test case:

```shell
echo "13 3 1" | python solution.py
```

Also, ensure that input is provided in the same format as expected by the `get_ints` function (space-separated integers on a single line) for correct behavior.
