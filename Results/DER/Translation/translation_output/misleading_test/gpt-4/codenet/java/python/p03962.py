Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
def main():
    # Read the input from the user splitting the input by space and casting to integers
    paint_cans = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Print the size of the set
    print(len(paint_cans))

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To match the test input and expected output provided, you can run the program and provide the input as follows:

Test input:
```
3 1 4
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

Please note that it seems there's a discrepancy between the given Java code and the expected output. The Java code calculates and prints the size of the HashSet (which is the number of unique paint cans), while the expected output is `24`, which does not relate to the sample input `3 1 4` in terms of set size. 

The provided Python code correctly translates the Java functionality and would output `3` for the input `3 1 4`. Please clarify if the expected output should indeed be `24` and provide the corresponding logic if the output isn't simply the size of the set.
