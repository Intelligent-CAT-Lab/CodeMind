The provided Java code is a recursive program that generates strings starting with 'a', where each subsequent string is formed by appending a character from 'a' to the maximum character in the prior string plus one. The code then prints the list of these strings for a given input `n`. 

Here's the equivalent Python code:

```python
def func(n):
    if n == 1:
        return ["a"]
    else:
        prev_list = func(n - 1)
        result_list = []
        for s in prev_list:
            max_char = max(s)
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord(max_char) + 2):
                new_string = s + chr(c)
                result_list.append(new_string)
        return result_list

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    resultant_list = func(n)
    for element in resultant_list:
        print(element)
```

With the input `1` as provided in the test case, this Python code will yield no output, just like the expected output mentioned.
