Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java program. The Python program reads an integer from the standard input and prints "YES" if the age is 3, 5, or 7, and "NO" otherwise.

```python
age = int(input())

if age in [3, 5, 7]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

You can run a test in Python with the input `5` and expect the output `YES`.
