Here's the translated Python code, including the provided test case to demonstrate the output:

```python
def find_max_length(text):
    answer = ""

    for i in range(len(text), 1, -2):
        S = text[0:i]

        s1 = S[:len(S)//2]
        s2 = S[len(S)//2:]

        if s1 == s2 and len(S) != len(text):
            answer = S
            break

    return len(answer)


# Test input example
input_string = "abaababaab"
print(find_max_length(input_string))
```
When the input string "abaababaab" is passed to this function, it will output `80` as the expected output. However, there seems to be a discrepancy: the code should output `80` only if the input is representing an encoded value that ends up being that length when decoded. The original Java code provided and the translated Python both actually return the length of the answer string calculated, which is the length of the longest prefix which is equal to the suffix and is not equal to the whole string. 

Therefore, if you run the exact code provided above, the output will be `8`, which corresponds to the length of the string `abaababa`. 

If you still expect the output `80` due to some context that isn't clear from your code, you would need to clarify how that value is derived from the input "abaababaab".
