Below is the translated Python code. Notice that in Python, you can directly read an input and perform the required conversion to int and division without needing a tokenizer like in Java. Additionally, in Python the `floor()` function is available in the `math` module but there is no need to use it explicitly for division because the `//` operator in Python automatically performs integer (floor) division.

```python
import math

# Read input from stdin
n = int(input())
answer = n // 3
print(answer)
```

This Python program will read an integer from the standard input, divide it by 3 using integer division, and then print the result, which should match the Java program's output for the same input.
