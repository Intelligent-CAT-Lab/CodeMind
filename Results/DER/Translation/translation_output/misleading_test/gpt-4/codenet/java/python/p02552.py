Here is a Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
# Get user input
n = int(input())

# Conditional output
if n == 0:
    print("1")
else:
    print("0")
```

However, please note that there seems to be a discrepancy between your provided test case and the code. The test case input is `1`, and according to the Java code, the expected output should be `0`. The comment in your question mentions the expected output as `-4`, which doesn't match the Java code's logic. Assuming the Java code is correct and we're translating that logic to Python, the output for input `1` should be `0`. If you need the output `-4` for some other reason, that's not reflected in the provided code. Would you please confirm or provide the correct logic that should be translated?
