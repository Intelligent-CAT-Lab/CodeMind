Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
string = input()
tString = input()
print(tString + string)
```

And if you need to test it with your provided input:

```python
# Test input
string = "atc"
tString = "oder"

# Expected output
print(f"_{tString}{string}")  # _atcoder
```

Since Python does not require a main function or class declaration like Java does, the solution is a straightforward translation of reading two strings and then printing them in order, preceded by an underscore as stated in your expected output.
