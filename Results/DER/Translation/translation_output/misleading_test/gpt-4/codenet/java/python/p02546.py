Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code snippet:

```python
# Get the input string from the user
s = input()

# Check if the input string ends with "s"
if s.endswith("s"):
    # Append "es" to the end of the string
    print(s + "es")
else:
    # Append "s" to the end of the string
    print(s + "s")
```

Now, you can run this Python code with the test input "apple" to get the expected output "apples". However, I noticed that the expected output you provided is "DmdZQr", which does not match the logical output of the provided Java code for the input "apple". The Java code you provided simply checks if a word ends with "s" and appends "es" to it, otherwise it appends "s".
