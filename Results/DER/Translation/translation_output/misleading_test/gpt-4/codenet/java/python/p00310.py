Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java code provided above:

```python
p, m, c = map(int, input().split())
print(p + m + c)
```

To run the sample test case, you would execute the script and input the string `"10 10 20"` when prompted for input. The Python script will then output `66`, which is the sum of the input integers.
