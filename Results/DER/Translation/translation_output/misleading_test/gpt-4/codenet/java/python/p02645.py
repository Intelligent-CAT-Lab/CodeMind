Here's the translated Python code from the provided Java code snippet:

```python
s = input()
print(s[0:3])
```

The Python code will read a string from the standard input, like the Java version, and then print the first three characters of the string. Python's string slicing is used here, where `s[0:3]` means getting the substring from index 0 to 3, not including index 3.

Here's how it would work with the provided test input:

Test input:
```
takahashi
```

Expected output:
```
tak
```

It appears that there's a discrepancy between the expected output of `taXk` and the expected behaviour of the code, which is to print only the first three characters of the input string (`tak`). If you need the output to be `taXk` based on some additional logic not described in the original code, please clarify so that I can provide the correct Python translation.
