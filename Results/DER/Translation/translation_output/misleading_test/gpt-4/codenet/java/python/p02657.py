Here's the translated Python code for the given Java code snippet:

```python
def main():
    A, B = map(int, input().split())
    print(A * B)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this Python code with the sample input `2 5`, the expected output would be `68` just like in the Java code.
