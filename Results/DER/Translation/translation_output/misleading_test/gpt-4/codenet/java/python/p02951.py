Here is a Python translation of the Java code you provided. The code reads three integers from the user input, and calculates the output as per the given logic.

```python
def p02951():
    # Read integers from input
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate and print result according to given conditions
    if b + c < a:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(b + c - a)

# Test the function with the given input
p02951()
```

To run this Python code, you should supply input in the same way as the Java code expects. In the test case you provided, the output should be `38`.

You would execute the program and then type `6 4 3` (the test input). The `print` function would then output `38` to the console.
