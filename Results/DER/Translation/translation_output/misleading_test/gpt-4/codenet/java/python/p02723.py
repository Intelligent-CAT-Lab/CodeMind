Here is the translated Python code based on the Java code you provided:

```python
# Read input string from user
s = input()

# Check if the third and fourth characters as well as fifth and sixth characters are the same
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

When you run this Python code with the test input `sippuu`, the expected output will be `No`, not `%gg` as you mentioned. The Java code checks for equality between the third and fourth characters, as well as the fifth and sixth characters of the input string and prints "Yes" if they are equal, otherwise "No". The translated Python code does the same comparison.
