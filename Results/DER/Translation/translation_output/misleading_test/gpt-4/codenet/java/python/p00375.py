Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Taking input from the user
a = int(input())

# Calculating and printing the result
print((a - 30) // 2)
```

The test input 68 should output 95 when plugged into the Python code:

```python
# Test input
a = 68

# The output should be 95
print((a - 30) // 2)
```
