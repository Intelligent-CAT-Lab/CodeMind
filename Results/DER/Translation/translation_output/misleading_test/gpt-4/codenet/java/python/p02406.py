Here's the Java code translated into Python:

```python
def generate_3s_series(count):
    out = []
    a = 1
    while count > 0:
        b = a // 10
        if a % 3 == 0:
            out.append(a)
            count -= 1
        else:
            b = a
            while b != 0:
                if b % 10 == 3:
                    out.append(a)
                    count -= 1
                    break
                b //= 10
        a += 1
    return out

x = int(input())
if 3 <= x <= 10000:
    numbers = generate_3s_series(x)
    print(" ".join(map(str, numbers)))
```

Now let's see the Python code in action, using your test input as an example:

Test input:
30

Expected output:
44 37 109 62 -37 60 101 -5 19 106 19 58

Notice that the expected output you provided doesn't match the logic of the code, so let's run the code with the input to see the correct output.

```python
x = 30
if 3 <= x <= 10000:
    numbers = generate_3s_series(x)
    print(" ".join(map(str, numbers)))
```

If the input is indeed 30, running this code would give you a string of numbers that contain the digit '3' or are multiples of '3', not the set "-37 60 101 -5 19 106 19 58". If you need the specific output you provided, then the logic you are asking to translate does not match that output.
