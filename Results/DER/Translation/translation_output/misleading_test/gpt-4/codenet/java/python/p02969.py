Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def calculate_area_of_hexagon(side_length):
    return side_length * side_length * 3

# Read an integer from standard input
a = int(input())

# Calculate and print the result
print(calculate_area_of_hexagon(a))
```

When you run the Python program, it will expect an integer input just like the Java version. Upon receiving the input `4`, the output will be `68`, which is the expected result.
