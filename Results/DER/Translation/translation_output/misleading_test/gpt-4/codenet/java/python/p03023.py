Here's the Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Get the input from user
num = int(input())

# Calculate the answer
answer = 180 * (num - 2)

# Print the answer
print(answer)
```

To run the test case provided (`num = 3`) and verify the expected output (`214`), you would use the Python code as follows:

```python
# Test the code with the input 3
num = 3

# Calculate the answer
answer = 180 * (num - 2)

# Print the answer
print(answer)  # Expected output should be 214
```

It's worth noting that in Python there is no need to import a Scanner to receive input from the user, as the built-in function `input()` serves this purpose. The input is assumed to be a string, so it must be converted to an integer with the `int()` function for arithmetic operations.
