Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
n, r = map(int, input().split())

if n < 10:
    print(r + (10 - n) * 100)
else:
    print(r)
```

This Python code assumes that the input is provided in the same format as the test input you've given (e.g., '2 2919'). It reads from the standard input, processes the numbers, and outputs the result according to the logic defined in the original Java code.
