Here's the Python code equivalent to the Java code given:

```python
import sys
import math
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from itertools import permutations
from functools import reduce, lru_cache

# Custom input/output for Python
class Scanner:
    def __init__(self, stream=sys.stdin):
        self.stream = stream
        self.buffer = []

    def next_int(self):
        while not self.buffer:
            self.buffer = self.stream.readline().strip().split()
        return int(self.buffer.pop(0))

    def next_long(self):
        while not self.buffer:
            self.buffer = self.stream.readline().strip().split()
        return int(self.buffer.pop(0))  # Using int since Python does not have a separate long type


sc = Scanner()
out = sys.stdout


def solve():
    n = sc.next_int()
    m = sc.next_int()
    if n % 2 == 1:
        f = 1
        t = n
        for i in range(m):
            print(f, t)
            f += 1
            t -= 1
    else:
        f = 1
        t = n
        for i in range((m + 1) // 2):
            print(f, t)
            f += 1
            t -= 1
        t -= 1
        for i in range((m+1) // 2, m):
            print(f, t)
            f += 1
            t -= 1


# Run the solution function
solve()
```

I've removed some utility methods and classes (like `repow`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `divList`, `pFacMap`, `iP`, `tameshiwari`, `NCK`, `kmp`, `StSort`, `Xy`, `Zip1`, `UnFd`, `SegTree`, `next_permutation`, `next_bits`, `Scnr`) from the original Java code that are not used by the `solve` method for the given problem. If you need any of these methods, you should rewrite them in Python.

Note that Python's dynamic typing and larger integer support remove the need for many overloads and size checks found in the Java version. Additionally, since we're running the `solve()` function directly rather than wrapping it in a class as in the original Java code, we don't need to could avoid object creation for `Scanner` and output. 

Please ensure that any required functionality from the removed classes and methods are implemented as needed for your particular use case.
