Here is the translated Python code:

```python
# Read input from the user
s = input().strip()

# Append '2' to the string
s += '2'

# Calculate the length of the string and initialize the answer
n = len(s)
ans = n - 1

# Loop through the characters of the string
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
        tmp = max(i + 1, n - i - 2)
        ans = min(ans, tmp)

# Print the result
print(ans)
```

You can run a test case in Python as follows:

```python
def compute_modified_input(s):
    s += '2'
    n = len(s)
    ans = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
            tmp = max(i + 1, n - i - 2)
            ans = min(ans, tmp)
    return ans

# Test input
test_input = "010"
# Expected output: 24
print(compute_modified_input(test_input))
```

In the provided example, the input is `"010"`, and the expected output is `24` when calling `compute_modified_input(test_input)`. However, this expected output does not match the Java code's behavior. If the Java code were correct, the expected output for the input "010" should be `1`. Please check the correctness of the expected output.
