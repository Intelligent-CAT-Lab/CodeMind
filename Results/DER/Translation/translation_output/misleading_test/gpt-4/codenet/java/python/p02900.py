Here's the translated Python code:

```python
import math

def gcd(n, m):
    return math.gcd(n, m)

def factors(n): # returns a set of the prime factors of the number n
    fact = set([1])
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            fact.add(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        fact.add(n)
    return fact

def main():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(len(factors(gcd(a, b))))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now let's see how it works using the provided test case:
```python
# Test input (from the example):
# 12 18
main()
```

Expected output:
```
-48
```

However, the expected output seems to be an error; the expected output should not be negative, as the function is meant to output the number of factors, which is a non-negative integer. So let's print the number of common factors between 12 and 18, which should output "4" for the factors {1, 2, 3, 6} in this case.
