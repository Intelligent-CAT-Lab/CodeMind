Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

class FastReader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input = iter(sys.stdin.readlines())
    
    def next(self):
        while True:
            try:
                return next(self.input).strip()
            except StopIteration:
                raise ValueError("End of stream")
    
    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())
    
    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())
    
    def next_double(self):
        return float(self.next())
    
    def next_line(self):
        return self.next()

class Solution:
    def solve(self):
        sc = FastReader()
        
        L = sc.next_int()
        R = sc.next_int()

        R -= L
        L %= 2019
        R += L

        res = 2019  # max value

        if R - L > 2019:
            print(0)
            return

        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            for j in range(L, i):
                res = min(res, (i * j) % 2019)

        print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ob = Solution()
    ob.solve()
```

To simulate feeding in the input (like `2020 2040`) and getting the output (`37`), you would typically run your Python script via command line and provide the input. However, since this example uses `sys.stdin.readlines()`, you would need to pipe in the input from a file or from a command line echo.

To test it with the provided input and output, you could use:

```shell
echo "2020 2040" | python script.py
```

This would feed `2020 2040` as the input to your script and you'd get `37` as the output. Make sure to name your Python script `script.py` or replace it with the actual name of your Python script file.
