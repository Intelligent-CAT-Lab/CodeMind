Here is the Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Read input from user
x, y = map(int, input().split())

# Check if x is divisible by y and output result accordingly
if x % y == 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x)
```

This Python code performs the same logic as the provided Java code. It reads two integers from the user separated by a space, checks if the first integer is divisible by the second, and prints `-1` if it is, otherwise it prints the first integer.
