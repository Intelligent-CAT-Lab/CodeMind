The Java code reads a string of digits from the input, counts the number of '1's, and prints that count. Below is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
a = input()
marbles = a.count('1')
print(marbles)
```

To match the provided sample test case, you could run this Python code and input `101`, and it would output `2`:

Test input:
`101`

Expected output:
`2`

(Note: You mentioned that the expected output is `59`, but based on the Java code, if the input is `101`, the number of '1's is actually `2`. If you need a different behavior, please specify the additional requirements.)
