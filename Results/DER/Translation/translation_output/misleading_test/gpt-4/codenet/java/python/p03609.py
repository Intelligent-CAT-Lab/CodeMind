Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from the user
x, t = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the appropriate result based on the condition
if x > t:
    print(x - t)
else:
    print(0)
```

To test this Python code with the given input (`100 17`), you would run the code and provide this input. The expected output would be `21`, as shown in the expected output of the original Java code sample.
