Below is the Python translation of the provided Java code. Since Java and Python handle I/O differently, the translated Python code directly reads from standard input using `input()` for simplicity:

```python
def main():
    N = int(input())
    if N == 1:
        print(1)
        return
    c = 1
    while 2 * c - 1 <= N:
        c *= 2
    c -= 1
    print(bin(c).count("1"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this code for the test input `2`, the expected output is `-29`, which doesn't seem to match the logic of the original Java code. The code is computing the number of one-bits in the binary representation of `c`, so for `N` equal to `2`, the output should be `1`, not `-29`.

To run the above Python code, simply execute it in a Python environment, and when prompted, enter the value `2`, and it will print out the number of one-bits in the binary representation of `c`, which is `1` in this case.
