Here is the translated Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

MOD = 1000000007

def pow(l, i):
    if i == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            val = pow(l, i // 2)
            return val * val % 2019
        else:
            return pow(l, i - 1) * l % 2019

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 2):
        f = i * (i - 1) // 2
        l = (n * 2 - i + 1) * i // 2
        add = l - f + 1
        ans = (ans + add) % MOD
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this translation, I've removed the `FastScanner` class as Python's built-in `input()` function, combined with `split()` and conversion functions, already provides fast and convenient input parsing for simple cases like this. The `mas` class does not have any use in the provided Java code as well, so I've excluded it.

To test the code with the provided test input "3 2" and to expect the output "-8", you must ensure that you're running the Python script with Python 3.x and use the following command:

```bash
echo "3 2" | python translated_script.py
```

Assuming `translated_script.py` is the filename of the translated Python script. This output may not match exactly due to the fact that the original Java code actually doesn't produce -8 with the input provided, instead, it calculates a value based on the variables `n` and `k`.
