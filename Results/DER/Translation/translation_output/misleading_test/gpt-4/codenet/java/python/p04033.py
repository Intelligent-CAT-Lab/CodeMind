To translate the provided Java code into Python, you need to handle input and if-else logic in a way that's idiomatic to Python. Here's the Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
# Read the space-separated integers as input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Check the range for zero
if a <= 0 <= b:
    print("Zero")
# Check the sign of the product of the range
else:
    print("Positive" if (min(0, b) - min(-1, a)) % 2 == 1 else "Negative")
```

To test this Python code with the input `1 3`, you can run it and provide the input directly:

```shell
$ echo "1 3" | python your_script.py
```

This should produce the expected output:

```
Positive
```
