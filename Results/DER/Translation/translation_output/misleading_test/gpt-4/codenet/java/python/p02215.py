Below is the translated Python code equivalent to the provided Java code snippet:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(X + 1)] for _ in range(512)] for _ in range(2)]

    for i in range(X + 1):
        dp[0][i][i] = 1

    t = 1
    for i in range(1, N):
        t = 1 - t
        for j in range(512):
            for k in range(X+1):
                dp[t][j][k] = 0

        for j in range(512):
            sum_ = 0
            for k in range(X + 1):
                sum_ += dp[1 - t][j][k]
                dp[t][j ^ k][k] += sum_
                dp[t][j ^ k][k] %= MOD

    ans = 0
    for i in range(X + 1):
        ans += dp[1 - t][X][i]

    print(ans % MOD)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To test the code with a given test input, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
echo "2 3" | python3 your_script.py
```

Alternatively, if you're using an interactive Python environment, you'd manually input "2 3" after running the script. The expected output for this test case, as stated, would be `101`.
