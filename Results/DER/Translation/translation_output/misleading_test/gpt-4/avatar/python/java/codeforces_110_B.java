Below is the provided Python code translated into Java. The translated code assumes that the standard input/output is used for simplicity. Java does not have built-in equivalents for the threaded approach used in the Python code to increase stack size, so such behavior is omitted in the translated code.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    private static final long MOD = 1000000007L;

    private static void solution() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 4; i++) {
            output.append("abcd");
        }
        output.append("abc".substring(0, n % 4));
        System.out.println(output);
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int t = 1; // Number of test cases is set to 1, similar to the Python code
        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            solution();
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the imported modules from the Python code (e.g., `collections.defaultdict`, `functools.lru_cache`, `heapq`, and `bisect`) and some operations (e.g., `hpop` and `hpush` as alias for `heappop` and `heappush`) are not translated since they were not used directly in the provided code snippet.

The translated Java code is a direct equivalent where user input is read from the standard input using `Scanner`, and the computed string is built using a `StringBuilder` for improved efficiency.

The code will work for the provided test input (`100`) and should produce the expected output, with the Java `main` method functioning similarly to the Python `main()` function for testing purposes.
