Certainly! Below is the equivalent Java code for the Python snippet you've provided. Please note that Java code involves a bit more structure, such as defining a class and using the main method to run the code.

Here is the translated code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ABChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();
        
        String result = (s.contains("A") && s.contains("B")) ? "Yes" : "No";
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

To run this Java code, you would need to compile it first and then execute the compiled class with a Java Virtual Machine. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine to do this.

Here's an example of how you might use this code:

Input:
```
BBA
```

Expected output:
```
Yes
```

Please note that Java is case-sensitive, and the input "BBA" contains both "A" and "B", so the output would be "Yes". However, there is a slight discrepancy: the expected output you mentioned is "o", but based on the given Python code, the output should actually be "Yes" if both "A" and "B" are present in the input string. Please ensure that the expected output aligns with the provided logic.
