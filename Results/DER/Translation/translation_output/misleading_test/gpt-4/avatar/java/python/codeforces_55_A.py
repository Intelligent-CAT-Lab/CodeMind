It looks like you've provided a Java code snippet which checks whether the input integer `n` is a power of two. If the condition satisfies (i.e., `n` is a power of two), the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". However, you've mentioned an expected output that doesn't correlate with the provided code. The provided output (`YGk`) doesn't seem to be related to checking if a number is a power of two.

Assuming you are asking for the Python equivalent of the Java code provided, here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```python
# Taking input from the user
n = int(input())

# Checking if the number is a power of two
if (n & (n - 1)) == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Now, to test the Python code with the input you've given (512), remember that 512 is indeed a power of two (`2^9`), so the expected output should be "YES". You may run the above Python code and input `512` to verify the output.

If you meant to provide a different Java code snippet or a different test case, please clarify so that I can assist you appropriately.
