Here is the translated code in Python:

```python
# Reading input
str = input()

# Checking conditions and printing output
if str == "AAA" or str == "BBB":
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")

# Example test case
print("Test input:")
print("BBA")
print("Expected output:")
print("Yes")
```

Please note that in the Java code, the output is either "Yes" or "No" based on whether the input contains only 'A' or 'B'. However, your test case expects an output of "Yzes" which does not align with the logic provided in the Java code. If you meant to test the Java code, the expected outcome for the input "BBA" would be "Yes" as written in the Python code above. If "Yzes" is the expected output for a different problem, please provide the correct matching Java code or requirements for proper translation.
