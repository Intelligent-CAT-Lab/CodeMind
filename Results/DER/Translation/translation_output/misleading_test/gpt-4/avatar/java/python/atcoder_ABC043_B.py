Below is the translated Python code for the Java code snippet you provided. The Python code is enclosed within triple backticks as requested:

```python
def atcoder_ABC043_B(s):
    while '0B' in s or '1B' in s:
        s = s.replace('0B', '')
        s = s.replace('1B', '')
        
    s = s.replace('B', '')
    return s


# Test input
test_input = "0000000000"
# Expected output: 78

# Printing the result of the function with the test input.
print(atcoder_ABC043_B(test_input))
```

A point to note is that the while loop conditions check for `'0B '` and `'1B '` with spaces in the original Java code, but in your input example, there are no spaces, so I have used `'0B'` and `'1B'` in the Python code. The expected output provided is `78`, but there's no arithmetic or conversion in the Java code to produce this result from the input "0000000000", it would simply remove the `B` characters. If the expected behavior is different, please provide additional context for an accurate translation.
