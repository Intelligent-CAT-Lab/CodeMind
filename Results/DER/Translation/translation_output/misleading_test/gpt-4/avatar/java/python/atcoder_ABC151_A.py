Here's the translated Python code that takes a character as input and outputs the next character in the ASCII sequence:

```python
def next_char(c):
    return chr(ord(c) + 1)

# Sample Test Case
test_input = 'c'
print(next_char(test_input))
```

Please note that, unlike Java's `Scanner`, Python takes input using the `input()` function. If you want to read a character from the user in a Python script, you would use `input()` to get a string and then select the first character. The `ord()` and `chr()` functions are used to convert the character to its ASCII value, increment it, and then convert it back to a character, respectively. 

The test case provided is hardcoded into the Python function. To actually use the function similarly to the Java code with user input, you would read input from the user and pass it to the function:

```python
def next_char(c):
    return chr(ord(c) + 1)

# Taking input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a character: ")
# Assuming the input is a single character
result = next_char(user_input[0])
print(result)
```

Please ensure the user provides a single character input to match the expected behavior of the original Java code.
