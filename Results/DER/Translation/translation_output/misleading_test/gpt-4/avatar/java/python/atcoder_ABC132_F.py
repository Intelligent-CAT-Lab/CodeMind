Here is the translated version of the given Java code into Python:

```python
def atcoder_ABC132_F(n, k):
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    
    len = []
    l = 1
    while l <= n:
        r = n // (n // l)
        len.append(r - l + 1)
        l = r + 1
    
    q = len(le)
    dp = [0] * (k * (q + 1))
    
    for j in range(1, q + 1):
        dp[j] = len[j - 1] + dp[j - 1]
    
    for i in range(1, k):
        for j in range(1, q + 1):
            dp[i * (q + 1) + j] = dp[i * (q + 1) + j - 1] + dp[(i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1] * len[j - 1]
            dp[i * (q + 1) + j] %= mod
    
    return dp[k * (q + 1) - 1]

# Sample Test Case
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(atcoder_ABC132_F(n, k))
```

To comply with Python syntax, note the following changes:
- The `ArrayList` was replaced by a standard Python list called `len`.
- `int` casting is not required in Python as division by default is floor division when using `//`.
- The array indexing follows Python's zero-based indexing.
- The `long[]` array was replaced by a standard Python list, and resizing it was achieved by specifying the size during initialization.
- The for-loops used `range` with the proper Python ranges.
- The `Scanner` object and related input code were replaced with a `map(int, input().split())` to read input.
- The `System.out.println` statement was replaced with a `print` statement.
