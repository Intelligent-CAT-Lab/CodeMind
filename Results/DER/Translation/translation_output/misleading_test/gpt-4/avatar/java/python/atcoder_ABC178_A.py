Here is the Python translation of the given Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
if x == 0:
    print("1")
else:
    print("0")
```

Keep in mind that in Python, you don't need to define a class or method to execute this simple logic. It's a straightforward script that works when executed directly.

Given your test input, I noticed your expected output doesn't match the logic of the given code. The Java code, if given `0` as input, will output `1`, not `25`. Assuming that was a typo in your instructions, I've translated the code as per its original logic. If `0` were given as an input to the Python code above, it would print `1` as well, not `25`. If you indeed want a different functionality, please provide the correct details, and I will update the code accordingly.
