Here's the translated Python code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = Counter()
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            factors[i] += 1
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

def main():
    N = int(input())
    factors_count = prime_factors(N)
    count = 0
    for factor, occ in factors_count.items():
        pow = occ
        increase = 1
        while pow - increase >= 0:
            pow -= increase
            increase += 1
            count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And here is how you would use the function with the given test case:

```python
# Test input
test_input = 366735600000

# Set 'input' to return the test input
input_original = input
input = lambda: str(test_input)

# Run the main function to obtain the expected output
main()  # This would print '9'

# Restore 'input' to its original state
input = input_original
```

To make the solution testable without altering the global `input` function, which would be considered bad practice in a real situation, you should ideally pass the input value as a parameter to the `main()` function or structure your program differently.
