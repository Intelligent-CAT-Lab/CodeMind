Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import re

def main():
    s = input().split()
    r = [s.count(word) for word in s]
    max_index = r.index(max(r))
    print(s[max_index], s[s.index(max(s, key=len))])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the following:

1. It reads a string from the user, splits it into words, and stores them in a list.
2. It counts the frequency of each word in the list and stores these frequencies in another list.
3. It finds the index of the maximum frequency in the frequency list and prints the corresponding word.
4. It finds the index of the longest word in the list and prints the corresponding word.

Please note that this Python code assumes that the input string does not contain any punctuation marks. If the input string can contain punctuation marks, you may need to modify the code to remove them before splitting the string into words.
