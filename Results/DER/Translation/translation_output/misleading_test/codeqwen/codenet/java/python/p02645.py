Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    print(s[:3])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string from the user, and then prints the first three characters of that string. The `input()` function in Python is equivalent to `Scanner(System.in).next()` in Java. The `print()` function in Python is equivalent to `System.out.println()` in Java. The `[:3]` syntax is used to get the first three characters of a string in Python.
