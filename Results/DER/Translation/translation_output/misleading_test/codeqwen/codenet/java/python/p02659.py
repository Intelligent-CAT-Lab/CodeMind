Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    b = float(input())
    bb = int((b * 100) + 0.5)
    ans = (a * bb) // 100
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two inputs, converts them to the appropriate types, performs the multiplication and division, and prints the result. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java for integer types.
