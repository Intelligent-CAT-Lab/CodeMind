Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    
    print((x*y)//2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads three integers from the user, calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `(x*y)/2`, and prints the result. The `//` operator is used instead of `/` to perform integer division, which is necessary when the result of the division should be an integer.
