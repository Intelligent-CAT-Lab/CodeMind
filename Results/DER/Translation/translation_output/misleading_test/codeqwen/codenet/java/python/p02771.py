Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())

if((A == B and B == C) or (A!=B and A!=C and B!=C)):
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if they are all equal or all different. If they are all equal, it prints "No". If they are all different, it prints "Yes".
