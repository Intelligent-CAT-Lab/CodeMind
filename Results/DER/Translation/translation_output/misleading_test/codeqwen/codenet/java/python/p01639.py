Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
import sys
import math

def solve(n, k, x0):
    if x0 == 0:
        print("0")
        return

    x = x0
    s = int(1e4)
    count = [0] * s
    offset = 2 ** 63
    M = s / (2 ** 64)
    for i in range(n):
        at = int((x + offset) * M)
        if at < 0:
            at = 0
        if at >= s:
            at = s - 1
        count[at] += 1
        x ^= x << 13
        x ^= x >> 7
        x ^= x << 17

    sum = 0
    length = -1
    target = -1
    for i in range(s):
        if sum <= k and k < sum + count[i]:
            target = i
            length = count[i]
            break
        sum += count[i]

    now = 0
    is_ = [0] * length
    x = x0
    for i in range(n):
        at = int((x + offset) * M)
        if at < 0:
            at = 0
        if at >= s:
            at = s - 1
        if at == target:
            is_[now] = x
            now += 1
        x ^= x << 13
        x ^= x >> 7
        x ^= x << 17

    is_.sort()
    print(is_[k - sum])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k, x0 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    solve(n, k, x0)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads the input from the standard input, solves the problem, and prints the result to the standard output. The `solve` function is the same as the `solve` method in the Java code. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the
