Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
next = 2
for i in range(x):
    next = (next + 1) * 2
print(next)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, then calculates the next number in the sequence by doubling the previous number and adding 1, and then prints the result.
