Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    length = len(s)

    cnt = 0
    l = 0
    r = length - 1
    while l <= r:
        cl = s[l]
        cr = s[r]

        if cl == cr:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            if cl == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                l += 1
            elif cr == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                cnt = -1
                break

    print(cnt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over the string from both ends towards the center. If the characters at the current left and right indices are the same, it moves the indices inward. If they are different, it checks if one of them is an 'x'. If it is, it increments the count and moves the index inward. If neither of them is an 'x', it sets the count to -1 and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints the count.
