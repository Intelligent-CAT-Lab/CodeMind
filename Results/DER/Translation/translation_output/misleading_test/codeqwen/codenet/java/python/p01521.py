Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    c = input()
    print("x" if c[0] == 'x' and c[-1] == 'x' else "o")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the first and last characters are 'x', and prints 'x' if they are, otherwise it prints 'o'.
