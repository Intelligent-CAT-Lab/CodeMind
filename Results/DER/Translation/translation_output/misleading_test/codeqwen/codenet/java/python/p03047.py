Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(n - k + 1)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, subtracts the second integer from the first, and then adds 1 to the result. The result is then printed to the console.
