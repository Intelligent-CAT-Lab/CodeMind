Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    S = input()

    ans = "Yes"

    if len(S) % 2 == 1:
        ans = "No"
    else:
        for i in range(0, len(S)//2, 2):
            if S[i:i+2] != "hi":
                ans = "No"

    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string from the user, checks if the length of the string is odd or even, and if it's even, it checks if every pair of characters in the string is "hi". If it finds a pair of characters that is not "hi", it sets the answer to "No". If it doesn't find any such pair, it sets the answer to "Yes". Finally, it prints the answer.
