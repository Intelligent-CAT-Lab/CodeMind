Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

d = a // b
r = a % b
f = "{:.5f}".format(a / b)

print(d, r, f)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, performs integer division and modulo operations, and then formats the result as a string with 5 decimal places. The result is then printed to the console.
