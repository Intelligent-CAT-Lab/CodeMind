Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
r = int(input())
if r < 1200:
    print("ABC")
elif r < 2800:
    print("ARC")
else:
    print("AGC")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer input from the user, checks if it's less than 1200, 2800, or greater than 2800, and prints the corresponding string.
