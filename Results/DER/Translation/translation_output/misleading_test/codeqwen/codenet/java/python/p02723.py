Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
s = input()

if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    print("%gg")
else:
    print("No")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the characters at indices 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the same, and prints the appropriate output.
