Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
N = int(input())
f = False
for A in range(1, 10):
    if N % A == 0 and N / A < 10:
        f = True
ret = "Yes" if f else "No"
print(ret)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, checks if it is divisible by any number from 1 to 9 and less than 10, and then prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise.
