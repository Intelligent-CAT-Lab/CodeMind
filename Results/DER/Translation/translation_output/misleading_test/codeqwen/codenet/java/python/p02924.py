Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())

result = 0
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    result += i

print(result)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the sum of all integers from `n - 1` down to `1`, and then prints the result.
