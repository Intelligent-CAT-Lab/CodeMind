Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def run():
    S = int(input())
    ans = S * S * S
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, squares it, and then prints the result. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to ensure that the `run()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
