Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code you provided:

```python
import sys

a = int(sys.stdin.readline())
b = int(sys.stdin.readline())

print(a // b)
```

This Python code reads two integers from the standard input, performs integer division on them, and prints the result. The `//` operator in Python performs integer division, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java for integers.
