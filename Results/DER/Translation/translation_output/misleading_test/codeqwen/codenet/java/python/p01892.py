Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
import sys

class p01892:
    def solve(self):
        self.A = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        self.B = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        self.N = int(sys.stdin.readline())

        ans = abs(self.A - self.B)
        for i in range(1, self.N + 1):
            for j in range(1, self.N + 1):
                if i * self.B % j != 0:
                    continue
                ans = min(ans, abs(self.A - i * self.B // j))

        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = p01892()
    p.solve()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and then iterates over all possible pairs of integers from 1 to N. If the product of the second integer and B is divisible by the first integer, it calculates the absolute difference between A and the quotient of the product of the second integer and B divided by the first integer, and updates the answer if this difference is smaller than the current answer. Finally, it prints the answer.
