Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(X + 1)] for _ in range(512)] for _ in range(2)]
    for i in range(X + 1):
        dp[0][i][i] = 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(1, N):
        t = 1 - t
        for j in range(512):
            dp[t][j] = [0 for _ in range(X + 1)]
        for j in range(512):
            sum_ = 0
            for k in range(X + 1):
                sum_ += dp[1 - t][j][k]
                dp[t][j ^ k][k] = (sum_ + dp[t][j ^ k][k]) % MOD
    ans = 0
    for i in range(X + 1):
        ans += dp[1 - t][X][i]
    print(ans % MOD)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers N and X from the standard input, and then calculates the number of ways to choose X elements from a set of 2^N elements. The result is then printed to the standard output.
