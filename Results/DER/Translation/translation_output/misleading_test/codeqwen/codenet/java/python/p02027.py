Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import math

def search(num, count, max):
    if count == 0:
        return 1
    if (num, count) in dp:
        return dp[(num, count)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(max / (num * math.pow(2, count - 1)))) + 1):
        total += search(num * i, count - 1, max)
    dp[(num, count)] = total
    return total

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.pow(2, k - 1)) + 1):
        total += search(i, k - 1, n)
    print(total)

dp = {}
main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store previously computed results for reuse. The `main` function reads the input, calls `search` with the appropriate arguments, and prints the result. The `search` function computes the total number of ways to partition `n` into `k` parts, where each part is a power of 2. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible partitions and adds up the results. The `search` function also uses memoization to store the results of each recursive call in the `dp` dictionary.
