Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    c = list(input())
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(c)):
        if c[i] == 'D' or c[i] == '?':
            count += 1
            c[i] = 'D'
    print(''.join(c))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, converts it to a list of characters, and then iterates over the list. If it encounters a 'D' or a '?', it increments a counter and replaces the character with 'D'. Finally, it prints the modified list as a string.
