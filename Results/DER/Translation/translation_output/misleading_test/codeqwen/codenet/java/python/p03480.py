Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    s += '2'
    n = len(s)
    ans = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
            tmp = max(i + 1,  n - i - 2)
            ans = min(ans,  tmp)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, adds '2' to the end of the string, and then iterates over the string to find the minimum length of the substring that can be removed to make the string a palindrome. The result is printed to the console.
