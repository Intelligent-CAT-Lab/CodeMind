Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    odd = 0
    for i in range(3):
        odd += int(input()) % 2
    print("Ho" if odd >= 2 else "Tem")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, adds them together and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Ho", otherwise it prints "Tem".
