Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    str = input()
    if str == "":
        return
    else:
        res = int(str)
        han = 0
        ni_beki = 1
        ruijyo = 0
        while True:
            han = (res >> ruijyo) % 2
            if han == 0:
                res = (res % ni_beki) + 1
                break
            else:
                ni_beki = ni_beki * 2
                ruijyo += 1
        print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then finds the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the input number and is a power of 2. The result is printed to the console.
