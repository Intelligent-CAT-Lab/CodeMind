Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print(1)
elif n == 1:
    print(2)
elif n == 2:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, and then uses an if-elif-else statement to print the corresponding output based on the value of the input.
