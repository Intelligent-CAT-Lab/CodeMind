Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a >= b:
    print(b * a)
else:
    print(a * b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, and then prints the product of the two integers if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, or the product of the second integer and the first integer otherwise.
