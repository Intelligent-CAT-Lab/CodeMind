Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
if x % 100 <= x // 100 * 5:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, checks if the last two digits are less than or equal to 5 times the first digit, and prints 1 if they are, and 0 otherwise.
