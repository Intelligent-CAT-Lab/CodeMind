Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60]
    i = int(input())

    print(ans[i])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, and then prints the corresponding value from the `ans` list. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
