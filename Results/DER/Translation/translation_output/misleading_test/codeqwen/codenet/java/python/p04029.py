Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i
print(sum)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to that number, and then prints the result.
