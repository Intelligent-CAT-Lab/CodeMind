Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve(S):
    dp = [1] + [0]*12
    base = 1
    for c in S[::-1]:
        if c == '?':
            for k in range(10):
                for j in range(13):
                    dp[(k*base+j)%13] += dp[j]
                    dp[(k*base+j)%13] %= 1000000007
        else:
            k = int(c)
            for j in range(13):
                dp[(k*base+j)%13] += dp[j]
                dp[(k*base+j)%13] %= 1000000007
        base *= 10
        base %= 13
    return dp[5]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    print(solve(S))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, computes the number of valid strings that can be formed by replacing the '?' characters with digits, and prints the result. The computation is done using dynamic programming, and the modulo operation is used to keep the numbers within a manageable range.
