Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    k = int(input())

    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return

    n = (k + 3) // 4 * 2

    ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            ret[i][j] = (i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : n) + (i + j) % n

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if ret[i][j] >= k:
                ret[i][j] = (ret[i][j] - n) % k

    print(n)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(ret[i][j] + 1, end=' ')
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
            sys.stdin = f
    solve()
```

Please note that the Python code assumes that the input is provided as command line argument. If you want to read input from standard input, you can remove the part where the input file is opened and closed.
