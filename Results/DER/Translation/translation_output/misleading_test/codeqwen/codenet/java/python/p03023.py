Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
num = int(input())

answer = 180 * (num - 2)

print(answer)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the answer, and then prints the answer. The `int()` function is used to convert the user input from a string to an integer.
