Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if abs(x-a) < abs(x-b):
    print("A")
else:
    print("B")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `a` and `x` and `b`, and then prints "A" if the difference between `x` and `a` is less than the difference between `x` and `b`, and "B" otherwise.
