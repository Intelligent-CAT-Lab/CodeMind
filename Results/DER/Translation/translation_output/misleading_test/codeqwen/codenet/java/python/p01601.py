Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def run():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        if is_palin(str(n-i)):
            print(n-i)
            break
        if is_palin(str(n+i)):
            print(n+i)
            break

def is_palin(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it finds the smallest palindrome that is either one or two numbers away from the input number. The `is_palin` function checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The `run` function does the main work of finding the palindrome. It iterates over all numbers from 0 to the input number, checking if the current number or the number two away from it is a palindrome. If it finds a palindrome, it prints it and breaks out of the loop.
