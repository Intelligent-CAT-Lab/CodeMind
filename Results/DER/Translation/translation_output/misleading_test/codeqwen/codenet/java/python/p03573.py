Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    C = int(input())

    if A == B:
        print(C)
    elif B == C:
        print(A)
    else:
        print(B)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the third integer. If not, it prints the integer that is not equal to the other two.
