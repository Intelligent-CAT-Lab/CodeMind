Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
num = int(input())
print(num**3)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, squares it, and then prints the result. The `**` operator in Python is equivalent to the `Math.pow` function in Java, which raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
