Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
print((a - 30) // 2)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it takes an integer input from the user, subtracts 30 from it, and then divides the result by 2. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java for integer division.
