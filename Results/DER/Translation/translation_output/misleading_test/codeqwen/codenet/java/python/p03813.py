Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    num = int(input())
    if num < 1200:
        print("ABC")
    else:
        print("ARC")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, checks if it is less than 1200, and prints "ABC" if it is, or "ARC" if it isn't. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
