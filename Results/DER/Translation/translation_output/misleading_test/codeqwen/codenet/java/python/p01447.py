Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    count = 0
    
    while n > 1:
        n = (n + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) // 3
        count += 1
    
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, then enters a loop that continues until the number is less than or equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, it performs the same operations as the Java code: it adds 3 to the number if it's not divisible by 3, and then divides the number by 3. It also increments a counter each time the loop iterates. Finally, it prints the counter.
