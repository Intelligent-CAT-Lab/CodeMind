Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
print(a*a*3)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, squares it, and then multiplies the result by 3. The `int(input())` function is used to read an integer from the user, and the `print()` function is used to output the result.
