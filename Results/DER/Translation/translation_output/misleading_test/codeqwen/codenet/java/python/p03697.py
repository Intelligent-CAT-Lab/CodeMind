Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if a + b >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(a + b)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result. If the sum of the two integers is 10 or more, it prints "error" instead.
