Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def permutation_whose_number_of_increasing_sequence_is_k(k):
    cur = (1 << (k + 1)).bit_length() - 1
    perm = [i for i in range(cur)]
    p = cur
    for d in range(cur - 1, -1, -1):
        x = 1 << d
        if cur + x <= k:
            cur += x
            perm.insert(d, p)
            p += 1
    return perm

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    perm = permutation_whose_number_of_increasing_sequence_is_k(n)
    print(len(perm) * 2)
    print(' '.join(str(i) for i in range(1, len(perm) + 1)))
    print(' '.join(str(i + 1) for i in perm))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the standard input, calculates the permutation, and prints the result. The `permutation_whose_number_of_increasing_sequence_is_k` function is a helper function that calculates the permutation. The `solve` function is the main function that reads the input, calls the helper function, and prints the result.
