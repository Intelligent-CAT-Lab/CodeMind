Here is the Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    d, t, s = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    ans = d / s
    if ans <= t:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the result of dividing the first integer by the third, and prints "Yes" if the result is less than or equal to the second integer, and "No" otherwise.
