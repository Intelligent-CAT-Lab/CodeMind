Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
        int A = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
        int B = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);

        int diff = A - B * 2;
        if (diff < 0) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            System.out.println(diff);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the difference between the first and the second integer times 2, and prints the result. If the result is negative, it prints 0 instead.
