Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = input / 100;
        String output = "ai1333" + "3".repeat(result);
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the user, divides it by 100, and then repeats the string "3" that many times. The result is then printed to the console.
