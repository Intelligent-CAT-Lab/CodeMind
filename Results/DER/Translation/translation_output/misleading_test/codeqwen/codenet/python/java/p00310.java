Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int p = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(p + m + c);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result.
