Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        if (y % x == 0) {
            System.out.println(x + y);
        } else {
            System.out.println(y - x);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if the second integer is divisible by the first one, and then prints the sum or difference accordingly.
