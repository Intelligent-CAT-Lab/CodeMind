Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double t = sc.nextDouble();
        double x = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.println(t/x);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two double values from the standard input, divides them and prints the result.
