Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a == b) {
            System.out.println(c);
        } else if (b == c) {
            System.out.println(a);
        } else {
            System.out.println(b);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the third integer. If not, it prints the second integer.
