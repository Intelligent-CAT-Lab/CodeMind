Here is the Java equivalent of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = (x - 30) / 2;
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, subtracts 30 from it, and then divides the result by 2. The result is then printed to the console.
