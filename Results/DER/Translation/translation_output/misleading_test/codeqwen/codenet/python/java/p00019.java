Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            k *= j;
        }
        System.out.println(k);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, multiplies all integers from 1 to the input number, and prints the result.
