Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int ss = scanner.nextInt();
        int hour = ss / (60 * 60);
        int second = ss % (60 * 60);
        int minute = second / 60;
        second = second % 60;
        System.out.println(hour + ":" + minute + ":" + second);
    }
}
```

This Java program does the same thing as your Python program. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the number of hours, minutes, and seconds, and then prints them out in the format "hour:minute:second".
