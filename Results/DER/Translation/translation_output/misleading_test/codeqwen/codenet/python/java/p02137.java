Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int input = scanner.nextInt();
        int output = (int) (input / 500 * 500);
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, performs the same calculation as your Python code, and then prints the result.
