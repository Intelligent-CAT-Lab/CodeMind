Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        if (s.charAt(2) == s.charAt(3) && s.charAt(4) == s.charAt(5)) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the 3rd, 4th, and 5th characters of the string are the same, and prints "Yes" if they are, and "No" if they are not.
