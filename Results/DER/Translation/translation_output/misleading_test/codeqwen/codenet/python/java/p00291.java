Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int c1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c5 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c10 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c50 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c100 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c500 = scanner.nextInt();
        int sum = c1 + c5*5 + c10*10 + c50*50 + c100*100 + c500*500;
        System.out.println(1 <= sum ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads six integers from the user, calculates the sum, and then prints 1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000, otherwise it prints 0.
