Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(3 * (r * r));
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, squares it, and then multiplies it by 3 before printing the result.
