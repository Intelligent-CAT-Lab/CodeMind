Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(800 * N - 200 * (N / 15));
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the result, and prints it out. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console. The `800 * N - 200 * (N / 15)` expression is the same as your Python code.
