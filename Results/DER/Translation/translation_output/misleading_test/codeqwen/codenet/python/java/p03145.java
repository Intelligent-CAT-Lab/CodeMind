Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a * b / 2);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the area of a triangle with these three sides, and prints the result.
