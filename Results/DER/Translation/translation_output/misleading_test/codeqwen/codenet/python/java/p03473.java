Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(48 - M);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads an integer from the user, subtracts it from 48, and prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
