Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int w = scanner.nextInt();
        int g = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(r + b + w + g);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code: it reads four integers from the user, adds them together, and prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
