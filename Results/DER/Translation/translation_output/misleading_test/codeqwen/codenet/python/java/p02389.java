Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a * b + (a + b) * 2);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, multiplies them, and then adds the result to twice the sum of the two numbers. The result is then printed to the console.
