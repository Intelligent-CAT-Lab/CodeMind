Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int g = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if ((g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0) {
            System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the user, multiplies the second by 10 and adds the third, and checks if the result is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
