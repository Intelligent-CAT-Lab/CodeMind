Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a == b && b == c) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if they are all equal. If they are, it prints "Yes". If they are not, it prints "No".
