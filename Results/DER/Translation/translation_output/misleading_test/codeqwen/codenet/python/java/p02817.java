Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.next();
        String T = scanner.next();

        System.out.println(T + S);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two strings from the user, concatenates them, and prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
