Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def can_take(x_needed, x_available, y_needed, y_available):
    if x_needed > x_available:
        return False
    if y_needed > y_available:
        return False
    return True

def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    turn = 0
    while True:
        if turn % 2 == 0:
            if can_take(2, x, 2, y):
                x -= 2
                y -= 2
            elif can_take(1, x, 12, y):
                x -= 1
                y -= 12
            elif can_take(0, x, 22, y):
                y -= 22
            else:
                print("Hanako")
                return
        else:
            if can_take(0, x, 22, y):
                y -= 22
            elif can_take(1, x, 12, y):
                x -= 1
                y -= 12
            elif can_take(2, x, 2, y):
                x -= 2
                y -= 2
            else:
                print("Ciel")
                return
        turn += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then enters a loop that alternates between the two players. The `can_take` function checks if the current player can take a certain amount of resources. If the player can take the resources, they are taken away from the available resources. If the player cannot take the resources, the game ends and the winner is printed. The `main` function reads the input, calls the `can_take` function, and prints the winner.
