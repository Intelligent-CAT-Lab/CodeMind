    if m == 0:
        return n
    return gcd(m, n % m)

        while n % i == 0:
            fact.add(i)
            n //= i

Explanation:

- We first define the `MODULO` variable as 1000000007, which is the value of the modulo used in the problem.
- The `gcd` function takes two numbers `n` and `m` and returns their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The `factors` function takes a number `n` and returns a set of its prime factors. It does this by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if they divide `n` evenly. If they do, they are added to the set of factors and `n` is divided by that number. This process is repeated until `n` is no longer divisible by any number in the range. If `n` is greater than 1, it is also added to the set of factors.
- The `main` function reads in two numbers `a` and `b` from standard input, computes their greatest common divisor using the `gcd` function, and prints the number of prime factors of the gcd using the `factors` function.
- We use the `FastReader` class to read input from standard input. This class is a modified version of the `BufferedReader` class that reads input in a more convenient way. We can use the `next` method to read in a single token, which can be converted to an integer or a long using the `nextInt` and `nextLong` methods, respectively. We can also use the `nextLine` method to read in a line of input as a string.<|endoftext|>
