        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt();
        int y = scan.nextInt();
        int z = scan.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println((x*y)/2);
        
    }
}
```

The above code is a simple program that takes three integers as input from the user and prints their average. The solution is to multiply the first two integers and divide the result by 2. The output is then printed to the console.<|endoftext|>
