## Problem

Write a program that reads two integers and prints their sum.

## Input

The input is given in a line. The first integer is given in the first element, and the second integer is given in the second element.

## Output

Print the sum of the two integers.

## Sample Input

```
1 2
```

## Sample Output

```
3
```

## Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

public class p00001 {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}
