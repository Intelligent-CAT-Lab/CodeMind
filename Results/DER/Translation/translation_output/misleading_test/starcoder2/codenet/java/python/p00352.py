## Problem

Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integers separated by a space.

## Output

Print the sum of the two integers to the standard output.

## Sample Input

```
1000 3000
```

## Sample Output

```
4000
```

## Solution

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)
```
