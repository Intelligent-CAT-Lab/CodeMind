# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

## What is a computer language?

A computer language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is a script?

A script is a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a script language?

A script language is a programming language that is designed to automate the execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed manually.

## What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture.

## What is an assembly language?

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## What is a machine code?

Machine code is the set of instructions that can be directly executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

## What is a bytecode?

Bytecode is a form of machine code that has been translated into a form that can be executed by a software interpreter.

## What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system.

## What is a virtual machine monitor?

A virtual machine monitor is a piece of software, firmware or hardware that provides an abstraction layer above a physical machine or host computer.
