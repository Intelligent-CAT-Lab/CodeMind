I am not sure if this is the best way to do it.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.min` or `if-else` to find the minimum.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.abs` or `if-else` to find the absolute value.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.count` or `for-loop` to count the number of `(` and `)`.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.substring` or `for-loop` to get the substring.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.indexOf` or `for-loop` to get the index of `*`.
