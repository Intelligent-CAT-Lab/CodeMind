import java.util.Scanner;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int i = 0;

        while (n / Math.pow(k, i) != 0) {

I am not sure if this is the correct way to do it.

I am also not sure if I should use `Math.pow` or `Math.pow(k, i)`

I am also not sure if I should use `n / Math.pow(k, i) != 0` or `n / Math.pow(k, i) == 0`
