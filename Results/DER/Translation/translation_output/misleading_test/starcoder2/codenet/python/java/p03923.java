I have tried to translate the code but I am getting wrong answer.

I am not able to understand the logic of the code.

Can anyone help me to understand the logic of the code and how to translate it to java?username_1: The code is using the [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to find the root of the function `f(x) = x^k - n`.

The code is trying to find the smallest integer `d` such that `d^k >= n`.

The code is using the fact that if `d` is the smallest integer such that `d^k >= n`, then `d-1` is the largest integer such that `(d-1)^k < n`.
