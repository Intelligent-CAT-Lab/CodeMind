# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

## What is a computer language?

A computer language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is a script?

A script is a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a script language?

A script language is a programming language that is designed to automate the execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed manually.

## What is a high-level programming language?

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## What is a low-level programming language?

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely to processor functions.

## What is an assembly language?

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## What is a machine code?

Machine code is the set of instructions that can be directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.

## What is an object code?

Object code is a form of machine code that is not directly executable by the CPU of a computer.

## What is a bytecode?

Bytecode is a form of machine code that is not directly executable by the CPU of a computer.

## What is a programming paradigm?

A programming paradigm is a style or "way" of programming.

## What is a procedural programming?

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

## What is a functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## What is an object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

## What is a declarative programming?

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

## What is a logical programming?

Logical programming is a programming paradigm that makes use of logic for problem solving.

## What is a concurrent programming?

Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm that allows concurrent execution of parts of a program.

## What is a parallel programming?

Parallel programming is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneoe of a computer program that is designed to be executed by a computer, rather than by a human.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
