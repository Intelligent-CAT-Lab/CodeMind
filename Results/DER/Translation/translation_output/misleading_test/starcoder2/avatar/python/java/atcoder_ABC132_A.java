# Diagonal Difference

Given a square matrix of size N×N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9

The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9=17. Their absolute difference is |15−17|=2.

Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

arr: an array of integers .

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the matrix arr.
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints

-100 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 100

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Sample Output

15

Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
   5
     -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

     4
   5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x

# Grading Students

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example, grade=84 will be rounded to 85 but grade=29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description

Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below. It should return an integer array consisting of rounded grades.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i], denoting student i's grade.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 60
0 ≤ grades[i] ≤ 100

Output Format

For each grades[i], print the rounded grade on a new line.

Sample Input 0

4
73
67
38
33

Sample Output 0

75
67
40
33

Explanation 0

Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75. Since 75-73<3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.
Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70-67=3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40-38<3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
Student 4 received a grade below 38, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.

You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
