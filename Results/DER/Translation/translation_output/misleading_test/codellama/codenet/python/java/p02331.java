Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2 3

Expected output:
20

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import math
import itertools as it
from collections import deque

sys.setrecursionlimit(10000000)

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())

print k ** n % MOD

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(k % MOD);
    }
}
```
This is a basic Java program that reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using the `Scanner` class, and then prints the result of `k % MOD` to the standard output.

The `MOD` constant is defined as `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is the modulus used in the Python program.

Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the standard input, and the `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the standard output.</s>
