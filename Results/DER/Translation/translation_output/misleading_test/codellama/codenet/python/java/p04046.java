Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2 3 1 1

Expected output:
54

```
import math
H, W, A, B = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

factorial = [1]
inv_factorial = [1]


for i in range(1, H+W+1):
    factorial.append(factorial[-1] * i % MOD)
    inv_factorial.append(pow(factorial[-1], MOD-2, MOD))


def f(h, w):
    return (factorial[h+w-2] * inv_factorial[h-1] * inv_factorial[w-1]) % MOD


answer = 0
for i in range(B+1, W+1):
    answer += f(H-A, i) * f(A, W-i+1)
    answer %= MOD

print(int(answer))

This is the Java code for the given Python code. The code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `Math` class is used to perform mathematical operations. The `MOD` variable is used to represent the modulus, which is used to ensure that the results of the calculations are within the desired range. The `factorial` and `inv_factorial` arrays are used to store the factorial and inverse factorial values, respectively. The `f` function is used to calculate the value of the expression `f(h, w)`, which is used in the calculation of the final answer. The `answer` variable is used to store the final result, which is printed to the console.</s>
