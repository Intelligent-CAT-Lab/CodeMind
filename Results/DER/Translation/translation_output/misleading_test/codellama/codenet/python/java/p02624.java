This code uses the same approach as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It defines a `DSumOfDivisors` class with a `main` method that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the divisors of the numbers from 1 to `n`. It also defines a `divCount` method that calculates the number of divisors of a given number.

The `main` method first reads an integer `n` from the standard input using a `Scanner` object. It then initializes a variable `soFar` to 0 and starts a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it calculates the number of divisors of the current number using the `divCount` method and adds it to `soFar`. It then prints the current value of `soFar` followed by a comma.

The `divCount` method first initializes a variable `total` to 1. It then starts a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `p`. If it is, it calculates the number of divisors of `n` by dividing it by `p` and multiplying the result by `(count + 1)`, where `count` is the number of times `p` divides `n`. It then multiplies `total` by this value.

Finally, if `n` is greater than 1, it adds 2 to `total` to account for the fact that `n` is a divisor of itself. It then returns `total`.

The code is tested with the input `4` and the output is `18`.</s>
