Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
20

```
from math import gcd
K = int(input())
ans = 0

for a in range(1, K+1):
    for b in range(1, K+1):
        for c in range(1, K+1):
            ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c)

print(ans)
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;

        for (int a = 1; a <= K; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= K; b++) {
                for (int c = 1; c <= K; c++) {
                    ans += gcd(gcd(a, b), c);
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}

This code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and it uses the `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The `gcd` function is defined in the code as a recursive function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The `main` method reads input from the user, calculates the sum of the greatest common divisors of all possible combinations of three numbers, and prints the result.</s>
