This is a Java implementation of the provided Python code. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math` class to perform mathematical operations. The `2 ** M` expression is used to calculate the power of 2 to the Mth power.

The `getNM()` function is not needed in Java, as the input can be read directly from the user using the `Scanner` class. The `getList()` function is also not needed, as the `Scanner` class can be used to read a list of integers directly.

The `from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter` statement is not needed in Java, as the `HashMap` class can be used to create a dictionary with default values. The `from sys import exit` statement is not needed in Java, as the `System.exit()` method can be used to exit the program.

The `import heapq` statement is not needed in Java, as the `PriorityQueue` class can be used to implement a heap. The `import math` statement is not needed in Java, as the `Math` class can be used to perform mathematical operations. The `import fractions` statement is not needed in Java, as the `BigDecimal` class can be used to represent fractions. The `import copy` statement is not needed in Java, as the `clone()` method can be used to create a copy of an object.

The `from itertools import permutations` statement is not needed in Java, as the `Collections.permutations()` method can be used to generate all permutations of a list.
