This code is a solution to the problem of counting the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The code first initializes the dp array with the value 1 in the first row and column, and the value 0 in all other cells. The string array is initialized with the letters A, B, and C. The num variable is initialized with the value 1000000007, which is a prime number that is used to ensure that the calculations do not overflow.

The code then iterates over the input string, and for each letter in the string, it calculates the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code uses the dp array to store the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times.

The code first checks if the current letter is a question mark. If it is, the code sets the value of b to 3, which means that the current letter can be repeated at most 3 times. If the current letter is not a question mark, the code sets the value of b to 1, which means that the current letter can be repeated at most 1 time.

The code then checks if the current letter is equal to the previous letter. If it is, the code sets the value of m to 1, which means that the current letter can be repeated at most 1 time. If the current letter is not equal to the previous letter, the code sets the value of m to 0, which means that the current letter can be repeated at most 3 times.

The code then calculates the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code uses the dp array to store the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code calculates the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times by multiplying the number of ways to form a string of length n - 1 from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times by the number of ways to form a string of length 1 from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code then adds the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times to the number of ways to form a string of length n - 1 from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times.

The code then prints the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code uses the dp array to store the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times. The code prints the value of the last cell in the dp array, which is the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times.

The code is written in Java, and it uses the Scanner class to read the input string from the user. The code is optimized to avoid overflow by using the modulo operator to ensure that the calculations do not exceed the maximum value of an integer. The code is also optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations by using the dp array to store the number of ways to form a string of length n from the letters A, B, and C, where each letter can be repeated at most 3 times.</s>
