Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
ab

Expected output:
42

```
from math import factorial as f
S = raw_input()
lS = len(S)
d = [S.count(i) for i in set(list(S))]
dd = sum([i%2 for i in d])
if (lS%2 == 0 and dd != 0 ) or (lS%2 == 1 and dd != 1): 
		print 0
else:
	dnm = 1
	for i in d:
		dnm *= f(i/2)
	print f(lS/2)/dnm

This code uses the `Scanner` class to read a line of input from the user, and then uses the `Set` class to store the unique characters in the input string. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the set and calculate the number of occurrences of each character in the input string.

The code then calculates the sum of the number of occurrences of each character that is odd, and checks if the sum is equal to 0 or not. If the sum is not equal to 0, it means that the input string contains an odd number of characters, and the code prints 0 as the output.

If the sum is equal to 0, the code calculates the factorial of the number of characters in the input string, and then divides it by the product of the factorials of the number of occurrences of each character that is even. This is done using a `for` loop that iterates over the number of occurrences of each character and calculates the factorial of each occurrence.

Finally, the code prints the result as the output.

Note that this code assumes that the input string contains only uppercase and lowercase letters, and that the number of characters in the input string is less than or equal to 100. If the input string contains any other characters or if the number of characters in the input string is greater than 100, the code may not work correctly.</s>
