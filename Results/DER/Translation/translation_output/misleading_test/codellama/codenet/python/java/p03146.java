This is a solution to the problem in Java. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `HashSet` class to keep track of the numbers that have been seen before. The `Deque` class is not used in this solution.

The `main` method first reads an integer `s` from the user using the `Scanner` class, and then initializes the `m` variable to 1. It then initializes the `pre` variable to `s`, and the `st` set to `{s}`.

The `while` loop continues until the `pre` variable is in the `st` set. If `pre` is even, it is divided by 2 and added to the `st` set. If `pre` is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and added 1, and then added to the `st` set. The `m` variable is incremented each time the loop iterates.

When the `pre` variable is in the `st` set, the `m` variable is printed to the console, and the program exits.

This solution is similar to the Python solution, but it uses Java's built-in data structures and algorithms instead of the `collections` and `numpy` libraries.</s>
