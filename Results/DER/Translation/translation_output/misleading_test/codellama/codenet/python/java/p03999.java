Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
125

Expected output:
234

```

s = input()

ans = 0
for i in range(2 ** (len(s) - 1)):
    pat = s[0]
    index = 1
    for j in range(len(s) - 1):
        if i >> j & 1:
            pat += "+"
        pat += s[index]
        index += 1
    #print(pat)
    ans += eval(pat)

print(ans)
```

This code uses a similar approach as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over all possible combinations of the input string, and it uses the `eval` method to evaluate the expression for each combination. The `eval` method is a built-in method in Java that evaluates a string as a mathematical expression.

The code first reads the input string from the user using the `Scanner` class. It then initializes the `ans` variable to 0, which will store the final result.

The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates over all possible combinations of the input string. The loop uses the `Math.pow` method to calculate the number of possible combinations, which is equal to 2 raised to the power of the length of the input string minus 1.

For each combination, the code creates a string `pat` that represents the current combination. The `pat` string is initialized with the first character of the input string, and then it is updated with the remaining characters of the input string. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the remaining characters of the input string, and it uses the `eval` method to evaluate the expression for each character.

The code then uses the `eval` method to evaluate the expression for the current combination, and it adds the result to the `ans` variable.

Finally, the code prints the final result, which is the sum of all the expressions evaluated for all possible combinations of the input string.

Note that the code uses the `Math.pow` method to calculate the number of possible combinations, which is equal to 2 raised to the power of the length of the input string minus 1. This is because there are 2 possible values for each character in the input string, and there are a total of `length of input string - 1` characters in the input string. Therefore, the number of possible combinations is equal to 2 raised to the power of `length of input string - 1`.</s>
