This code reads a string from standard input, and then uses a sliding window of size 3 to find the first occurrence of the substring "needed". If such a substring is found, the indices of the first and last characters of the substring are printed to standard output. If no such substring is found, the indices -1 and -1 are printed.

The code uses a list `last` to keep track of the indices of the last occurrence of each character in the string. The list is initialized with -1 for all characters, and then updated as the string is processed. The sliding window is implemented using a for loop that iterates over the characters of the string, and a conditional statement that checks if the current character is the first character of the substring "needed". If the substring is found, the indices of the first and last characters are printed, and the program exits. If the substring is not found, the program continues to the next character in the string.

The code also uses the `ord` function to convert the characters to their ASCII values, and the `chr` function to convert the ASCII values back to characters. This is necessary because the `ord` function returns an integer, and the `chr` function expects an integer as input.

The code also uses the `strip` method to remove any trailing newline characters from the input string. This is necessary because the `readline` method returns a string that includes the newline character at the end.</s>
