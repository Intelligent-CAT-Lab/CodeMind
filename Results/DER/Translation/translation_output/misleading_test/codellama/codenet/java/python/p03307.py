This is a simple program that reads an integer `n` from standard input, and then prints the result of the `problem102a` function, which takes `n` as an argument and returns either `n` or `n * 2` depending on whether `n` is even or odd.

The `problem102a` function is defined as a private method inside the `p03307` class, which is the main class of the program. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it reads an integer `n` from standard input using the `BufferedReader` class, and then prints the result of the `problem102a` function using the `System.out.println` method.

The `BufferedReader` class is used to read input from standard input, and the `InputStreamReader` class is used to convert the input stream into a string. The `Integer.parseInt` method is used to convert the input string into an integer.
