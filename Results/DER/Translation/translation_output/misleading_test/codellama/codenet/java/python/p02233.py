```python
import sys

def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print(fib(n))
```
This is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Python. The `fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function uses memoization to store the results of previous calculations, which helps to improve the performance of the function.

The `if` statement at the beginning of the function checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1 directly. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as inputs, and adds the results together to get the final answer.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is a common pattern in Python programs that runs the main code only when the program is run directly, rather than when it is imported as a module. In this case, it reads a single integer from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, and then prints the result of the `fib` function with that input.</s>
