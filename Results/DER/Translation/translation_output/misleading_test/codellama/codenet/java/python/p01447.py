Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
8

Expected output:
-49

```
import java.util.Scanner;
 
 
public class p01447{
     
    public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    	final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
    	long n = sc.nextLong();
    	int count = 0;
    	
    	while(n > 1){
    		n  = (n + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) / 3;
    		count++;
    	}
    	
    	System.out.println(count);
    	
    }
     
}
```

```
import math

def get_count(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 1:
        n = (n + (n % 3 == 0) * (3 - n % 3)) // 3
        count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(get_count(n))
```
This code uses the same logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It defines a function `get_count` that takes a single argument `n`, which is the input number. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 3 and increment a counter `count` until `n` is less than or equal to 1. The function returns the value of `count` at the end.

The main part of the code takes the input from the user, converts it to an integer using the `int` function, and then calls the `get_count` function with the input number as an argument. The result of the function call is then printed to the console.

Note that the code uses the `//` operator to perform integer division, which is equivalent to the `floor` function in Java.</s>
