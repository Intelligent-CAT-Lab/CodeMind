Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
010

Expected output:
24

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p03480 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		sc.close();
		s += '2';
		int n = s.length(), ans = n - 1;
		for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
			if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i + 1)) {
				int tmp = Math.max(i + 1,  n - i - 2);
				ans = Math.min(ans,  tmp);
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}

```python
import math

def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] != s[i + 1]:
            tmp = max(i + 1, n - i - 2)
            ans = min(ans, tmp)
    return ans

s = input()
print(solve(s))
```

Explanation:

The code first defines a function `solve` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be changed to make the string palindromic.

The function first calculates the length of the string `n` and initializes the minimum number of characters that need to be changed `ans` to `n - 1`.

The function then iterates over the characters of the string `s` and checks if the current character is the same as the next character. If they are not the same, it calculates the maximum number of characters that need to be changed to make the string palindromic `tmp` and updates `ans` with the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tmp`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be changed to make the string palindromic.

The code then takes a string `s` as input and prints the result of the `solve` function with the input string.</s>
