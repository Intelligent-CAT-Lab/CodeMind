<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
oxoxoxoxoxoxox

Expected output:
YESO

```
x=input()
a=0
for i in x:
  if i=='x':
    a+=1
print(["NO","YES"][a<=7])
```

### Response:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String x = scanner.next();
        int a = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < x.length(); i++) {
            if (x.charAt(i) == 'x') {
                a++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(a <= 7 ? "NO" : "YES");
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the input, counts the number of 'x' characters in it, and then prints "YES" if the count is less than or equal to 7, and "NO" otherwise.
