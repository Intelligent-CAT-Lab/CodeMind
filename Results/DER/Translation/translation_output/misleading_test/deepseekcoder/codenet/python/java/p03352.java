<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
10

Expected output:
19

```
x = int(input())
ans = 1
for b in range(x):
    for p in range(2, x):
        if b**p <= x:
            ans = max(ans, b**p)
        else:
            break
print(ans)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = 1;
        for (int b = 2; b <= x; b++) {
            for (int p = 2; p <= x; p++) {
                if (Math.pow(b, p) <= x) {
                    ans = Math.max(ans, (int) Math.pow(b, p));
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the input, then calculates the maximum power of any number up to that integer that is less than or equal to the integer. The result is printed to the console.
