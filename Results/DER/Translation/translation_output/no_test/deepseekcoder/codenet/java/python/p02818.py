<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class p02818{
    static public void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        //BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        //String[] buf = reader.readLine().split(" ");
        long A = sc.nextLong(), B = sc.nextLong(), K = sc.nextLong();
        if(K<=A){
            A -= K;
        } else if(K <= A+B){
            B -= K-A;
            A = 0;
        } else {
            A = 0; B = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(A+" "+B);
    }
}


```

### Response:
```python
import sys

def main():
    A, B, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    if K <= A:
        A -= K
    elif K <= A + B:
        B -= K - A
        A = 0
    else:
        A = 0
        B = 0
    print(A, B)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the standard input, and then modifies the first two based on the third. If the third integer is less than or equal to the first, it subtracts the third from the first. If the third integer is less than or equal to the sum of the first and second, it subtracts the difference between the third and the first from the second, and sets the first to 0. If the third integer is greater than the sum of the first and second, it sets both the first and second to 0. Finally, it prints the two modified integers.
