<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N,A,B = map(int,input().split())
print(min(A,B),max(A+B-N,0))
```

### Input

The first line of input contains three integers N,A,B.

### Output

Print the minimum of A and B, followed by the maximum of A+B-N and 0.

### Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= A,B <= 10^9

### Example

```
Input:
3 10 10

Output:
10 10
```

### Explanation

The minimum of A and B is 10.

The maximum of A+B-N and 0 is 10.

### Hint

Use the ```System.out.print()``` method to print the output.
