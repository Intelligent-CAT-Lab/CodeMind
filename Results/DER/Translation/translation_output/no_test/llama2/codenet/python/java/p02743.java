<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if c-a-b < 0:
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes' if 4*a*b < (c-a-b)**2 else 'No')
```

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $a,b,c$ denoting the values of $a,b,c$ respectively.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the word 'Yes' if the statement is true and 'No' otherwise.

### Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 100$

$1 \leq a,b,c \leq 10^9$

### Sample Input

```
3
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

### Sample Output

```
Yes
No
Yes
```

### Explanation

In the first test case, $a=1,b=2,c=3$ and $c-a-b=2$.

In the second test case, $a=1,b=2,c=3$ and $c-a-b=0$.

In the third test case, $a=1,b=2,c=3$ and $c-a-b=1$.
