<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
n=int(input())%10
if n==3:
    print("bon")
elif n in [2,4,5,7,9]:
    print("hon")
else:
    print("pon")

```

### 1. Solution

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if (n == 3) {
            System.out.println("bon");
        } else if (n == 2 || n == 4 || n == 5 || n == 7 || n == 9) {
            System.out.println("hon");
        } else {
            System.out.println("pon");
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Explanation

```
n=int(input())%10
```

This line is used to get the input from the user and convert it to an integer. The modulo operator (%) is used to get the remainder of the division of the input by 10.

```
if n==3:
    print("bon")
```

This if statement checks if the input is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "bon".

```
elif n in [2,4,5,7,9]:
    print("hon")
```

This elif statement checks if the input is in the list [2,4,5,7,9]. If it is, it prints "hon".

```
else:
    print("pon")
```

This else statement checks if the input is not in the list [2,4,5,7,9]. If it is, it prints "pon".

### 3. Code Testing

```
Input: 3
Output: bon

Input: 2
Output: hon

Input: 4
Output: hon

Input: 5
Output: hon

Input: 7
Output: hon

Input: 9
Output: hon

Input: 1
Output: pon

Input: 0
Output: pon

Input: 8
Output: pon
```

### 4. Code Review

This code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of the modulo operator to get the remainder of the division of the input by 10 is a good way to check if the input is a multiple of 10. The use of the if, elif, and else statements to check different conditions is also well-organized.

### 5. Code Improvements

There are no major improvements that can be made to this code. However, it would be good to add some error handling to check if the input is a valid integer and to handle any invalid inputs.

### 6. Code Complexity

This code is relatively simple and easy to understand. It has a complexity of O(1) for the modulo operator and O(n) for the if, elif, and else statements.
