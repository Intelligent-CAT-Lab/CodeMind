@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
K = int ( input ( ) )
cnt = 0
now = 0
if K % 2 == 0 :
    print ( - 1 )
    sys . exit ( 0 )
for i in range ( 10 ** 6 ) :
    cnt += 1
    now = ( now * 10 + 7 ) % K
    if now == 0 :
        print ( cnt )
        sys . exit ( 0 )
print ( - 1 )


```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, checks if it's even, and if it's not, it calculates the remainder of the sequence of numbers (now * 10 + 7) % K for a million times. If the remainder is 0, it prints the number of iterations and exits. If it doesn't find a remainder of 0 after a million iterations, it prints -1 and exits.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
