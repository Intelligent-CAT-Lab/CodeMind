<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s = input ( )
t = ' , . ? ! '
for i in t : s = s . replace ( i , i + ' â ' )
s = ' â ' . join ( s . strip ( ) . split ( ) )
for i in t : s = s . replace ( ' â ' + i , i )
print ( s )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        String t = " ,.?! ";
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            s = s.replace(String.valueOf(t.charAt(i)), " " + t.charAt(i) + " ");
        }
        s = " ".join(s.strip().split(" "));
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            s = s.replace(" " + t.charAt(i), String.valueOf(t.charAt(i)));
        }
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, replaces certain characters with a space followed by the character and a space, joins the words with a space, and then replaces the space followed by a character with just the character. The result is then printed to the console.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
