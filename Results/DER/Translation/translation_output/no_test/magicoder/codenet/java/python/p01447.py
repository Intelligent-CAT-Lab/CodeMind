@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
 
 
public class p01447{
     
    public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    	final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
    	long n = sc.nextLong();
    	int count = 0;
    	
    	while(n > 1){
    		n  = (n + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) / 3;
    		count++;
    	}
    	
    	System.out.println(count);
    	
    }
     
}
```

@@ Response
```python
import sys

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    count = 0

    while n > 1:
        n = (n + (n % 3 if n % 3 != 0 else 0)) // 3
        count += 1

    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a number from the standard input, then it calculates the number of steps needed to reduce the number to 1 by dividing it by 3, and it keeps track of the number of steps. The number is reduced by 3 if it's not divisible by 3, or by 0 if it is. The process is repeated until the number is 1. The number of steps is then printed to the standard output.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
