@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class p00290 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(d*c);

    }
}


```

@@ Response
```python
# Python code

# importing the built-in module for input
import sys

# reading input from the user
d = int(sys.stdin.readline())
c = int(sys.stdin.readline())

# printing the product of d and c
print(d*c)
```

In Python, we don't need to import any specific libraries for input. We can use the built-in `sys.stdin.readline()` function to read input from the user. The `int()` function is used to convert the input into an integer. The `print()` function is used to output the result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
