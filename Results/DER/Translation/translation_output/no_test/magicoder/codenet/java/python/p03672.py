<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p03672 {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		String s = scan.next();
		
		String s1 = "";
		String s2 = "";
		
		String answer ="";
		
		
		
		for(int i = s.length();i>=2;i=i-2){
			String S = s.substring(0,i);
			
			s1 = S.substring(0, S.length()/2);
			s2 = S.substring(S.length()/2, S.length());
			
			
			if(s1.equals(s2)&&S.length()!=s.length()){
				answer =S;
				break;
			}
			
		}
		
		
		
		System.out.println(answer.length());
		
		
	}

}

```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

    s1 = ""
    s2 = ""

    answer = ""

    for i in range(len(s), 1, -2):
        S = s[:i]

        s1 = S[:len(S)//2]
        s2 = S[len(S)//2:]

        if s1 == s2 and len(S) != len(s):
            answer = S
            break

    print(len(answer))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, then it iterates over the string in steps of 2 characters, and for each step, it checks if the first half of the string is equal to the second half. If it is, it saves the string and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints the length of the saved string.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
