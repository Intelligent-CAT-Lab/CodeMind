<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02663 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int h1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int h2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int k = nextInt(scanner);
        int h = h2 - h1;
        int m = m2 - m1;
        int day = (h * 60) + m;
        System.out.println(day - k);

    }

    public static int nextInt(Scanner scanner) {
        return Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
    }
}

```

@@ Response
```python
import sys

def next_int(scanner):
    return int(scanner.readline())

def main():
    scanner = sys.stdin
    h1 = next_int(scanner)
    m1 = next_int(scanner)
    h2 = next_int(scanner)
    m2 = next_int(scanner)
    k = next_int(scanner)
    h = h2 - h1
    m = m2 - m1
    day = (h * 60) + m
    print(day - k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code you provided. It reads integers from the standard input (sys.stdin), calculates the difference between two times and subtracts a given number. The result is then printed to the standard output.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
