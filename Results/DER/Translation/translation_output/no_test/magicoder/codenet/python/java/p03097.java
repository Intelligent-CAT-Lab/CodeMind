Please note that Java does not support list comprehension like Python does. So, we have to use a for loop to add elements to the list. Also, Java does not have a built-in function for bitwise right shift assignment (`>>=`), so we have to use the bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) and bitwise AND operator (`&`) to achieve the same result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
