<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
print(input()[::-1])

```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Java code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String reversed = new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();
        System.out.println(reversed);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a line of input from the user, reverses it, and then prints the reversed string.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
