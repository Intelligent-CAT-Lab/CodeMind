<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s=input()
count=0
for member in s:
    count=0
    for member2 in s:
        if member2==member:
            count+=1
    if count>=2:
        print("no")
        break
if count==1:
    print("yes")

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char member = s.charAt(i);
            count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
                char member2 = s.charAt(j);
                if (member2 == member) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count >= 2) {
                System.out.println("no");
                break;
            }
        }
        if (count == 1) {
            System.out.println("yes");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then checks each character in the string to see if it appears more than once. If it does, it prints "no" and breaks the loop. If it doesn't, it prints "yes".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
