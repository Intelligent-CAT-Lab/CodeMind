<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s = raw_input()
print 'x' if s[0]=='x' and s[-1]=='x' else 'o'
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        if (s.charAt(0) == 'x' && s.charAt(s.length() - 1) == 'x') {
            System.out.println('x');
        } else {
            System.out.println('o');
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the first and last characters of the string are 'x', and then prints 'x' if they are, otherwise it prints 'o'.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
