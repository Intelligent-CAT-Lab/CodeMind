<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
S = input()

alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
Now = 0
ans = 0
for s in S:
    Next = alpha.find(s)
    # print(s, Now, Next)

    if(Now < Next):
        pass
    else:
        ans += 1
    Now = Next
print(ans)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();

        String alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int Now = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            char s = S.charAt(i);
            int Next = alpha.indexOf(s);
            // System.out.println(s + " " + Now + " " + Next);

            if (Now < Next) {
                // do nothing
            } else {
                ans += 1;
            }
            Now = Next;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it finds its position in the string `alpha` and checks if the current position `Now` is less than the position of the character in `alpha`. If it is, it does nothing. If it's not, it increments the counter `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
