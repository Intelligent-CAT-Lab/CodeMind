Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(fib(N + 1));
    }

    public static int fib(int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n];
        memo[0] = 2;
        memo[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
        }
        return memo[n - 1];
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads an integer from the user, calculates the Fibonacci number at that position, and prints the result. The `fib` function is the same as your Python function, but it uses an array instead of a list.
