Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] numbers = input.split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(numbers[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(numbers[1]);
        int c = Integer.parseInt(numbers[2]);

        if ((a < c && c < b) || (a > c && c > b)) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads three integers from the user, then checks if the first number is less than the second and the second is less than the third, or if the first number is greater than the second and the second is greater than the third. If either condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
