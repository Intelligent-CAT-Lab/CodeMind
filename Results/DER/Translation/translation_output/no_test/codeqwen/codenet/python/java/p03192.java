Here is the Java equivalent of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String N = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
            if (N.charAt(i) == '2') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads a line of input from the user, counts the number of times the character '2' appears in the line, and then prints that count.
