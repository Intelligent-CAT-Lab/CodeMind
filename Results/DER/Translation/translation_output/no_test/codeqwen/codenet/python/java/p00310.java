Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int p = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(p + m + c);
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we are using the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user. The `nextInt()` method is used to read the integer values entered by the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the sum of the three integers.
