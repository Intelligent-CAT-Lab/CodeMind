Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(lcm(A, B));
    }

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static int lcm(int a, int b) {
        return a * b / gcd(a, b);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates their least common multiple (LCM) using the `lcm` function, and prints the result. The `gcd` function is implemented in a similar way to your Python code.
