Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int R = scanner.nextInt();
        int G = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int cnt = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r <= n / R; r++) {
            for (int g = 0; g <= (n - r * R) / G; g++) {
                int b = (n - r * R - g * G) / B;
                if (r * R + g * G + b * B == n) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(cnt);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads four integers from the user, calculates the number of combinations where the sum of the cubes of the three colors is equal to the total number of colors, and prints the result.
