Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
                if (s.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count >= 2) {
                System.out.println("no");
                break;
            }
        }
        if (count == 1) {
            System.out.println("yes");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads a string from the user, then checks each character in the string to see if it appears more than once. If it does, it prints "no" and breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't find any character that appears more than once, it prints "yes".
