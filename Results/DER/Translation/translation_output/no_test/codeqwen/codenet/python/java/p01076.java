Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        if (d == 1) {
            System.out.println(n * (n - 1) / 2);
        } else {
            System.out.println((n - 1) + (n - d - 1) * n - ((n - d - 1) * (n + d - 2) / 2));
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, `n` and `d`, and then calculates and prints the result based on the values of `n` and `d`.
