Here is the Java equivalent of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] numbers = input.split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(numbers[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(numbers[1]);
        int c = Integer.parseInt(numbers[2]);

        if (a < b && b < c) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads a line of input, splits it into three parts (assuming they are integers), and then checks if the first number is less than the second, and if the second is less than the third. If they are, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
