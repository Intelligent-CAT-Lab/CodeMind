Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println((n-1)*n/2);
    }
}
```

In Java, we use `Scanner` class to get user input. The `nextInt()` method is used to get the integer input from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Java.
