Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def run():
    s = input()
    c = [s.count('K'), s.count('U'), s.count('P'), s.count('C')]
    print(min(c))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, counts the occurrences of 'K', 'U', 'P', and 'C' in the string, and then prints the minimum of these counts.
