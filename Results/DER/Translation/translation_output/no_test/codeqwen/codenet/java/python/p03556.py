Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import math

def execute():
    r = math.sqrt(int(input()))
    print(int(r * r))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, calculates the square root of the integer, squares the result, and prints the result. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `execute()` function when the script is run directly.
