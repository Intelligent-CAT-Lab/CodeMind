Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
X = int(input())
Y = int(input())

i = 0
while X <= Y:
    i += 1
    X *= 2

print(i)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, then it doubles the first integer until it is greater than the second integer, and finally it prints the number of times it doubled the first integer.
