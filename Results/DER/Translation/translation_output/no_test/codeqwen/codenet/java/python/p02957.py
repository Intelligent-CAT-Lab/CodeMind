Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
k = a + b
if k % 2 == 0:
    print(k // 2)
else:
    print("IMPOSSIBLE")
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to read user input, and `int()` to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java.
