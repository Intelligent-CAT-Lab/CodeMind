Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

a = int(sys.stdin.readline())
b = int(sys.stdin.readline())
k = int(sys.stdin.readline())

set = set()
cnt = 0
for i in range(a, b+1):
    if cnt >= k:
        break
    cnt += 1
    set.add(i)
cnt = 0
for i in range(b, a-1, -1):
    if cnt >= k:
        break
    cnt += 1
    set.add(i)

for ans in sorted(set):
    print(ans)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the standard input, creates a set, and then adds integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and from `b` to `a` (inclusive) to the set. If the number of elements in the set is greater than or equal to `k`, it breaks the loop. Finally, it prints the elements of the set in ascending order.
