Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
amount = 0
time = a

for i in range(2, c + 1):
    amount += b
    time = a * i

print(amount)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the amount of money accumulated after a certain number of years, and then prints the result.
