Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    S = input()
    ans = 0
    if len(S) % 2 == 0:
        if S[len(S) // 2 - 1] != S[len(S) // 2]:
            print(len(S) // 2)
            return
        else:
            S = S[:len(S) // 2] + S[len(S) // 2 + 1:]
            ans = 1
    mid = len(S) // 2
    for i in range(1, mid + 1):
        if i + mid == len(S) or S[mid + i] != S[mid] or S[mid - i] != S[mid]:
            ans += mid + i
            break
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the length of the string is even, and if so, checks if the characters at the two middle positions are the same. If they are not, it prints the index of the middle character and returns. If they are the same, it removes the middle character and increments a counter. Then it checks for palindromes starting from the middle and moving outwards. If it finds a palindrome, it adds the length of the palindrome to the counter and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints the counter.
