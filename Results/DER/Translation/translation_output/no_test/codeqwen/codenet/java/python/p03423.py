Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import math

def main():
    l = input()
    answer = math.floor(int(l.split()[0]) / 3)
    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python code, we use the `input()` function to read a line of input from the user. We then split the line into a list of words using the `split()` function, and take the first word (which should be the number we want to divide by 3) and convert it to an integer using the `int()` function. We then divide this number by 3 and use the `math.floor()` function to round down to the nearest integer. Finally, we print the result.
