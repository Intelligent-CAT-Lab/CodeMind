Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
ans = "ai1333"
for i in range(x // 100):
    ans += "3"
print(ans)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, adds "3" to the string "ai1333" for each 100 units in the input number, and then prints the resulting string.
