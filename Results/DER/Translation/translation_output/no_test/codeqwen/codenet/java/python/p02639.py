Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = [0]*5
sum = 0
for i in range(5):
    x[i] = int(input())
    sum += x[i]
print(15-sum)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It initializes an array `x` with 5 zeros, then it reads 5 integers from the user, adds them to the array, and finally prints the difference between 15 and the sum of the array elements.
