Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
n = int(input())

if n >= b:
    print(a * (b - 1) // b)
else:
    print(a * n // b)
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and we use the `int()` function to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java.
