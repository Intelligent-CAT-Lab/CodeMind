Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    N = int(input())
    M = int(input())

    print(abs((N-2) * (M-2)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads two integers from the user, calculates the absolute value of the product of the two numbers after subtracting 2 from each, and then prints the result.
