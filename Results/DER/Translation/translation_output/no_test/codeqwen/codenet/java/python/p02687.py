Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code you provided:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def main():
    s = input()
    print("ARC" if s == "ABC" else "ABC")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads a string from the user, checks if it is equal to "ABC", and prints "ARC" if it is, or "ABC" if it isn't. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
