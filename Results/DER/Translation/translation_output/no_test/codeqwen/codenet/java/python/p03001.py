Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
w = int(input())
h = int(input())
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
ans = (w * h) / 2
a = 1 if x + x == w and y + y == h else 0
print(ans, a)
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code. It reads four integers from the user, calculates the area of a rectangle using these integers, checks if the rectangle is a square, and then prints the area and whether it is a square.
