Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())

print((x*y)//2)
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and `int()` to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java.
