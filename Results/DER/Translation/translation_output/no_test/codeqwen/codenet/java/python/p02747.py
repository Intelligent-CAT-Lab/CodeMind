Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def main():
    S = input()

    ans = "Yes"

    if len(S) % 2 == 1:
        ans = "No"
    else:
        for i in range(0, len(S)//2, 2):
            if S[i:i+2] != "hi":
                ans = "No"

    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the length of the string is odd or even, and then checks every pair of characters in the string to see if they are "hi". If any pair of characters is not "hi", it sets the answer to "No". If the string passes all these checks, it prints "Yes".
