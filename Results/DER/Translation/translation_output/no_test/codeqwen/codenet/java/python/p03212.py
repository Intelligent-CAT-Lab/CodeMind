Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    set_ = set()
    queue = ["357", "375", "537", "573", "735", "753"]
    count = 0
    ch = ['3', '5', '7']
    if N < 1000:
        for s in queue:
            if int(s) <= N:
                count += 1
        print(count)
        return
    while queue:
        s = queue.pop(0)
        if int(s) <= N:
            count += 1
            for i in range(len(s) + 1):
                for j in range(len(ch)):
                    temp = add_char(s, i, ch[j])
                    if temp not in set_:
                        set_.add(temp)
                        queue.append(temp)
    print(count)

def add_char(s, location, c):
    return s[:location] + c + s[location:]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the standard input, checks if it's less than 1000, and if so, counts the number of strings that are less than or equal to the input number and start with the characters '3', '5', or '7'. If the input number is greater than or equal to 1000, it uses a queue to generate all possible strings that are less than or equal to the input number and start with the characters '3', '5', or '7'. It then counts the number of strings in the queue that are less than or equal to the input number.
