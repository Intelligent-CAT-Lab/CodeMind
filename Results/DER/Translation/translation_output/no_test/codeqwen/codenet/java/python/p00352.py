Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    num1 = int(input())
    num2 = int(input())
    print((num1 + num2) // 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and `int()` to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
