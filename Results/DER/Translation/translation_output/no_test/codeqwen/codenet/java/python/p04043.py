Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if a == 5 and b == 7 and c == 5:
    print("YES")
elif a == 5 and b == 5 and c == 7:
    print("YES")
elif a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and we use the `int()` function to convert the input from a string to an integer. The rest of the code is the same as the Java code.
