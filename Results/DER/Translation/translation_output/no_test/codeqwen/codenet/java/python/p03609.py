Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
t = int(input())

if x > t:
    print(x - t)
elif x <= t:
    print(0)
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and we use the `int()` function to convert the input from a string to an integer. The rest of the code is the same as the Java code.
