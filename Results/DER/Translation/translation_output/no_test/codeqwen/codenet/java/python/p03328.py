Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
n = b - a
print((n * (n + 1)) // 2 - b)
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and `int()` to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java.
