Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

ans = (b-1)//(a-1)
if (b-1)%(a-1)==0:
    print(ans)
else:
    print(ans+1)
```

In Python, the `//` operator is used for integer division, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java. The `%` operator is used for the remainder of the division.
