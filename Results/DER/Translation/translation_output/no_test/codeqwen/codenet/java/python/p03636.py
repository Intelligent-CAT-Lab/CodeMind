Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
s = input()
leng = len(s)
print(s[0], leng-2, s[-1], sep='')
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and the `len()` function to get the length of a string. We use string indexing to access individual characters in the string. The `sep=''` argument in the `print()` function is used to prevent Python from adding a space between the characters.
