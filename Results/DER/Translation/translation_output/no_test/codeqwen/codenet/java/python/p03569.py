Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    length = len(s)

    cnt = 0
    l = 0
    r = length - 1
    while l <= r:
        cl = s[l]
        cr = s[r]

        if cl == cr:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            if cl == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                l += 1
            elif cr == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                cnt = -1
                break

    print(cnt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, then checks each character from both ends of the string. If the characters are the same, it moves the pointers towards the center. If the characters are different, it checks if one of them is 'x'. If it is, it increments the counter and moves the pointer towards the center. If neither of the characters is 'x', it sets the counter to -1 and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints the counter.
