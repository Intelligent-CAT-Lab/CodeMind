Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    S = int(input())
    list_ = [i for i in range(1, S + 1)]
    ans = sum(i for i in list_ if i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 != 0)
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the user, creates a list of integers from 1 to the input number, and then calculates the sum of all the integers in the list that are not divisible by 3 or 5. The result is then printed to the console.
