Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    count = 0
    for i in range(a, b+1):
        array = [int(x) for x in str(i)]
        if array[0] == array[-1] and array[1] == array[-2]:
            count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then iterates over all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive). For each integer, it converts it to a string, then to a list of integers. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, and the second and second-to-last elements are the same, it increments the count. Finally, it prints the count.
