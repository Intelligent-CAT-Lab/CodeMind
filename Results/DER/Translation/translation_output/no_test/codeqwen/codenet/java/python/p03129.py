Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def main():
    num1 = int(input())
    num2 = int(input())
    if (num1 + 1) // 2 >= num2:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the result of the expression `(num1 + 1) // 2`, and compares it to `num2`. If the result is greater than or equal to `num2`, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
