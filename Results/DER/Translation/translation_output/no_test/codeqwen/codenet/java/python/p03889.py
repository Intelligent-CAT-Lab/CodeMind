Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    arr = list(s)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == 'b':
            arr[i] = 'd'
        elif arr[i] == 'd':
            arr[i] = 'b'
        elif arr[i] == 'p':
            arr[i] = 'q'
        elif arr[i] == 'q':
            arr[i] = 'p'
    arr.reverse()
    if s == ''.join(arr):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, replaces 'b' with 'd', 'd' with 'b', 'p' with 'q', and 'q' with 'p', reverses the string, and then checks if the original string is equal to the reversed string. If they are equal, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
