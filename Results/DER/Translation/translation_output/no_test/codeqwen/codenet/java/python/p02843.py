Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
x = int(input())
if x % 100 <= x // 100 * 5:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

In Python, we use the `input()` function to get user input, and `int()` to convert the input to an integer. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which is equivalent to `/` in Java. The `%` operator is used for the modulo operation, which is also equivalent to `%` in Java.
