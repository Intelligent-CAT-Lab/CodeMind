Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def solve():
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    if A > 9 or B > 9:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(A * B)

solve()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if they are less than 10, and if they are, it multiplies them and prints the result. If they are not, it prints -1.
