Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    c = list(input())
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(c)):
        if c[i] == 'D' or c[i] == '?':
            count += 1
            c[i] = 'D'
    print(''.join(c))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the user, replaces all '?' characters with 'D', and then prints the modified string. The `main()` function is defined to encapsulate the logic of the program. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
