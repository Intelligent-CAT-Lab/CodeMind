Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())
N = B // A

if N > C:
    print(C)
else:
    print(N)
```

In Python, we use the `//` operator for integer division, which is equivalent to `/` in Java but returns an integer result. Also, Python uses `input()` function to get user input, which is equivalent to `Scanner` in Java.
