Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
paint_cans = set()
paint_cans.add(int(input()))
paint_cans.add(int(input()))
paint_cans.add(int(input()))

print(len(paint_cans))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, adds them to a set, and then prints the number of unique integers in the set. The `set` data structure in Python automatically removes duplicates, so this code effectively counts the number of unique paint cans.
