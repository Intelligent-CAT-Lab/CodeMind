Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    profile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

    stack_down = []
    stack_area = []
    stack_edge = []
    total_area = 0
    pos = 0
    lv = 0

    for c in profile:
        if c == '\\':
            lv -= 1
            stack_down.append(pos)
        elif c == '/':
            lv += 1
            if stack_down:
                start = stack_down.pop()
                temp_area = pos - start
                total_area += temp_area
                if not stack_area:
                    stack_area.append(temp_area)
                    stack_edge.append(lv)
                else:
                    last_area = 0
                    while stack_edge and stack_edge[-1] < lv:
                        last_area += stack_area.pop()
                        stack_edge.pop()
                    stack_area.append(last_area + temp_area)
                    stack_edge.append(lv)
            else:
                if stack_area:
                    stack_edge.pop()
                    stack_edge.append(lv)

        pos += 1

    print(total_area)
    print(len(stack_area))
    if stack_area:
        print(' '.join(map(str, stack_area)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, then it uses three stacks to calculate the total area and the areas of each section of the profile. The total area is calculated by subtracting the positions of the downwards slashes from the positions of the upwards slashes. The areas of each section are calculated by subtracting the positions of the downwards slashes from the positions of the upwards slashes and adding the last area. The areas are stored in the `stack_area` stack, and the positions of the downwards slashes are stored in the `stack_down` stack. The positions of
