Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

d = a // b
r = a % b
f = "{:.5f}".format(a / b)

print(d, r, f)
```

In Python, we use the `//` operator for integer division and the `%` operator for the remainder of the division. The `format` function is used to format the floating point number to 5 decimal places. The `input` function is used to take user input.
