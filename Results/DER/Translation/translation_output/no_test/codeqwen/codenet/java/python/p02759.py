Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
N = int(input())
print((N + 1) // 2)
```

In Python, the `//` operator is used for integer division, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java but returns an integer result. The `input()` function is used to read an integer from the user.
