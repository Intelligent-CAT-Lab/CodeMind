Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def is_palin(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def run():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        if is_palin(str(n - i)):
            print(n - i)
            break
        if is_palin(str(n + i)):
            print(n + i)
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it finds the smallest palindrome that is either one or two numbers away from the input number. It does this by checking each number from the input number down to 0, and then checking each number from the input number up to 0. If it finds a palindrome, it prints it and breaks out of the loop.
