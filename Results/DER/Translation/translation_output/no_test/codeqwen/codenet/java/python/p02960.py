Here is the Python version of the Java code:

```python
import sys

class p02960:
    def solve(self):
        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        d = list(S)
        dp = [0] * 13
        dp[0] = 1
        base = 1
        for i in range(len(d) - 1, -1, -1):
            next_dp = [0] * 13
            if d[i] == '?':
                for k in range(10):
                    for j in range(13):
                        next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                        next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007
            else:
                k = int(d[i])
                for j in range(13):
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007
            dp = next_dp
            base *= 10
            base %= 13
        print(dp[5])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main = p02960()
    main.solve()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, converts it to a list of characters, and then calculates the number of valid strings that can be formed by using the characters in the list. The result is printed to the standard output.
