Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
def main():
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    a = x
    b = y
    while x % y != 0:
        z = x
        x = y
        y = z % y
    m = a + b - y
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 or a == b or (a % 2 > 0 and b % 2 > 0):
        print(m + 1)
    else:
        print(m)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as your Java code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, and then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers. If the sum of the two numbers is even, it prints the LCM plus one; otherwise, it prints the LCM.
