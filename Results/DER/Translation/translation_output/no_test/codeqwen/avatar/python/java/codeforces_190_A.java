Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (n < 1) {
            if (m < 1) {
                System.out.println(n + " " + m);
                return;
            }
            System.out.println("Impossible");
            return;
        }
        if (m > n) {
            int min = m;
            int max = n + m - 1;
            System.out.println(min + " " + max);
        }
        if (m <= n) {
            int min = n;
            int max = n + m - 1;
            if (m == 0) {
                max = n;
            }
            System.out.println(min + " " + max);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the user, checks if they are less than 1, and if so, prints them and exits. If the second number is greater than the first, it prints the smaller number and the sum of the two numbers minus 1. If the second number is less than or equal to the first, it prints the first number and the sum of the two numbers minus 1. If the second number is 0, it sets the maximum to the first number.
