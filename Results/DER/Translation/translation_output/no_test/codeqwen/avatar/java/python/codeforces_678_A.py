Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    k = int(input())
    
    print((n // k + 1) * k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In Python, we use the `//` operator for integer division, which is equivalent to `/` in Java. The `input()` function in Python reads a line of text from the user, and `int()` is used to convert the input to an integer. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
