Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n = int(input())
s = ''.join(str(i) for i in range(1, n+1))
print(s[-1])
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the user, creates a string of numbers from 1 to the input number, and then prints the last character of the string.
