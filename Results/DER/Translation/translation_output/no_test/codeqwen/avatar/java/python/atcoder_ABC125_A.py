Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
n, k, m, l, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(1, n//a + 1):
    k += b
print(k)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads three integers from the user, calculates the number of times the value `b` can be added to `k` (which is equivalent to the number of times `a` can be added to `n`), and then prints the result.
