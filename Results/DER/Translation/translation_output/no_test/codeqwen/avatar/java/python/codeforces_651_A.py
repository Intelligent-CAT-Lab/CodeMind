Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def main():
    num1 = int(input())
    num2 = int(input())
    counter = 0

    while num1 != 0 and num2 != 0:
        if num1 == 1 and num2 == 1:
            break

        if num1 <= num2:
            num1 += 1
            num2 -= 2
        else:
            num1 -= 2
            num2 += 1

        counter += 1

    print(counter)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, then enters a loop that continues until either `num1` or `num2` is 0. In each iteration of the loop, it either increments `num1` by 1 and decrements `num2` by 2, or vice versa, depending on which is smaller. It then increments `counter` by 1. After the loop, it prints the value of `counter`.
