Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
import math

a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = round(b * 100)
d = a * c
print(d // 100)
```

In Python, we use `int()` to convert a string to an integer and `float()` to convert a string to a float. The `round()` function rounds a number to the nearest integer. The `//` operator performs integer division in Python, which is equivalent to the `/` operator in Java for integer division.
