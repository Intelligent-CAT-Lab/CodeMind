Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code:

```python
def solve():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    if a == b:
        return a * 2
    elif a > b:
        return a * 2 - 1
    else:
        return b * 2 - 1

print(solve())
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the user, compares them, and returns the appropriate result. The `input()` function in Python is equivalent to `Scanner(System.in)` in Java. The `int()` function in Python is equivalent to `nextInt()` in Java. The `print()` function in Python is equivalent to `System.out.println()` in Java.
