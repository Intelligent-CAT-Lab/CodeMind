# 1000. A+B

## Description

Write a program that reads two integers and prints their sum.

## Input

The first line contains the first integer. The second line contains the second integer.

## Output

Print the sum of two integers.

## Sample Input

```
1
2
```

## Sample Output

```
3
```

## Hint

Use the following code to read two integers:
```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

## Solution

python code:
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)
```

java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}
```

## Translation

Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)/problems/1001/1001.md
