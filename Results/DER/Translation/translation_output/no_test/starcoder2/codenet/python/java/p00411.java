## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates a program written in a high-level language into a program that can be run on a computer.

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a program that executes a program written in a high-level language.

## What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

## What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute.

## What is an object code?

An object code is a set of instructions that a computer can execute.

## What is source code?

Source code is a set of instructions written in a high-level language.

## What is an executable program?

An executable program is a program that can be run on a computer.

## What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a bug?

A bug is an error in a program.

## What is a syntax error?

A syntax error is an error in a program that makes it impossible to compile the program.

## What is a runtime error?

A runtime error is an error in a program that makes it impossible to execute the program.

## What is a semantic error?

A semantic error is an error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

## What is a logical error?

A logical error is an error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

## What is a syntax diagram?

A syntax diagram is a diagram that shows the structure of a program.

## What is a parse tree?

A parse tree is a tree that shows the structure of a program.

## What is an abstract syntax tree?

An abstract syntax tree is a tree that shows the structure of a program.

## What is a control flow?

A control flow is the order in which statements in a program are executed.

## What is a block?

A block is a set of statements that are executed together.

## What is a statement?

A statement is a set of instructions that tell a computer to do something.

## What is an expression?

An expression is a set of values and operators that can be evaluated to produce a value.

## What is an assignment statement?

An assignment statement is a statement that assigns a value to a variable.

## What is a variable?

A variable is a name that refers to a value.

## What is a value?

A value is a set of bits that represents a number or a character.

## What is a type?

A type is a set of values that have the same properties.

## What is an integer?

An integer is a type of value that represents a whole number.

## What is a floating-point number?

A floating-point number is a type of value that represents a real number.

## What is a string?

A string is a type of value that represents a sequence of characters.

## What is a character?

A character is a type of value that represents a letter, digit, or symbol.

## What is a boolean?

A boolean is a type of value that represents either true or false.

## What is an operator?

An operator is a symbol that represents a computation.

## What is an arithmetic operator?

An arithmetic operator is an operator that performs an arithmetic operation.

## What is a relational operator?

A relational operator is an operator that compares two values.

## What is a logical operator?

A logical operator is an operator that performs a logical operation.

## What is a bitwise operator?

A bitwise operator is an operator that performs a bitwise operation.

## What is a shift operator?

A shift operator is an operator that shifts the bits in a value.

## What is an assignment operator?

An assignment operator is an operator that assigns a value to a variable.

## What is a compound assignment operator?

A compound assignment operator is an operator that combines an assignment and an arithmetic operation.

## What is a unary operator?

A unary operator is an operator that takes one operand.

## What is a binary operator?

A binary operator is an operator that takes two operands.

## What is a ternary operator?

A ternary operator is an operator that takes three operands.

## What is a function?

A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.

## What is a function definition?

A function definition is a statement that creates a new function.

## What is a function call?

A function call is a statement that executes a function.

## What is a function header?

A function header is a part of a function definition that specifies the name and parameters of the function.

## What is a function body?

A function body is a part of a function definition that specifies the statements that make up the function.

## What is a function declaration?

A function declaration is a statement that tells the compiler about the name, parameters, and return type of a function.

## What is a function prototype?

A function prototype is a statement that tells the compiler about the name, parameters, and return type of a function.

## What is a function parameter?

A function parameter is a variable that is used to pass a value to a function.

## What is a function argument?

A function argument is a value that is passed to a function.

## What is a function return value?

A function return value is a value that is returned by a function.

## What is a function return type?

A function return type is a type that is returned by a function.

## What is a function call stack?

A function call stack is a stack that stores information about the active functions in a program.
