Here is the Java code translated to Python. Note that Python does not naturally support a direct equivalent of Java's streams, and standard input/output in Python is typically handled with simpler functions such as `input()`, `print()`, or the `sys` and `io` modules. Therefore, the translation of `FastIO`, the `Debug` class, and the threading parts have been adapted to be more Pythonic. Also, the `Charset` library has been omitted because in Python, encoding is often less explicitly managed.

```python
# No direct equivalent in Python for InputStream and OutputStream. They could be replaced by open() or sys.stdin, sys.stdout.
import sys
import threading


class Task:
    def __init__(self, debug):
        self.debug = debug
        self.inf = int(1e8)
        self.lInf = int(1e18)
        self.dInf = 1e50

    def solve(self):
        s = list(input())
        n = len(s)

        kmp = KMPAutomaton(n)
        inv = KMPAutomaton(n)
        for i in range(n):
            kmp.build(s[i])
            inv.build(s[n - i - 1])
        p = n - kmp.fail[n]
        if n % p != 0:
            p = n

        if p == 1:
            self.answer(n, 1)
            return
        if p == n:
            self.answer(1, 1)
            return

        cnt = 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            p1 = i - 1 - kmp.fail[i - 1]
            p2 = (n + 1 - i) - inv.fail[n + 1 - i]

            f1 = p1 == (i - 1) or (i - 1) % p1 != 0
            f2 = p2 == (n + 1 - i) or (n + 1 - i) % p2 != 0
            if f1 and f2:
                cnt += 1

        self.answer(2, cnt)

    def answer(self, length, count):
        print(length)
        print(count)


class KMPAutomaton:
    def __init__(self, cap):
        self.data = [''] * (cap + 2)
        self.fail = [-1] + [0] * (cap + 1)
        self.buildLast = 0
        self.matchLast = 0
        self.length = cap

    def build(self, c):
        self.buildLast += 1
        trace = self.fail[self.buildLast - 1]
        while trace >= 0 and self.data[trace + 1] != c:
            trace = self.fail[trace]
        self.fail[self.buildLast] = trace + 1
        self.data[self.buildLast] = c


class Debug:
    def __init__(self, allow_debug):
        self.allow_debug = allow_debug

    def debug(self, name, value):
        if self.allow_debug:
            print(f"{name} = {value}")


def main(local, async_):
    debug = Debug(local)

    task = Task(debug)

    def run_task():
        task.solve()

        if local:
            memory = (sys.getsizeof(object) >> 20)
            print("\n\n--memory--\n" + str(memory) + "M")

    if async_:
        # Running the task in a separate thread with a large stack size.
        thread = threading.Thread(target=run_task)
        thread.start()
        thread.join()
    else:
        run_task()


# Main code
local = False
async_ = False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(local, async_)
```

Couple points to note during translation:

1. The `main` method in Java is replaced with directly executable Python code in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.
2. The `Debug` class's various methods are replaced by a single `debug` method that takes a variable `value`. Python's dynamic typing makes it unnecessary to have different methods.
3. The `FastIO` class is dropped entirely, as Python's `input()` and `print()` functions serve this example well for reading strings; file or binary input/output requires different handling in Python.
4. Java's threading paradigm is replaced by using Python's `threading` module. The same stack size considerations that may apply in Java are not as relevant in Python's `Thread`.
5. Consumption of system resources and memory profiling in Python is different from Java and not directly relevant to the problem, so the memory debug feature is implemented only in a very simplified way.
