Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java source:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    n = scan_int()
    d1 = scan_int()
    d2 = scan_int()
    d1s, d2s = 0, 0
    
    while (d1 & 3) == 0:
        d1s += 1
        d1 >>= 2
    while (d2 & 3) == 0:
        d2s += 1
        d2 >>= 2
    
    need = n * n
    for i in range(2 * n):
        for j in range(2 * n):
            if (d1 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d1s) ^ (j >> d1s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d1 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d1s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d2s) ^ (j >> d2s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d2s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            
            print(f"{i} {j}")
            need -= 1
            if need == 0:
                return
    raise AssertionError

def scan_int():
    return int(scan_string())

def scan_long():
    return int(scan_string())

def scan_string():
    global tok
    while tok is None or not tok:
        tok = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
    return tok.pop(0)

in_file = sys.stdin
out_file = sys.stdout
tok = None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        solve()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

Please note the following major translations between Java and Python in this code:
1. There is no equivalent to "import static" in Python; instead, we define the required functions directly.
2. I/O in Python is usually done with `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`. `print` is used for output instead of `PrintWriter`.
3. Instead of throwing an `AssertionError`, we raise one.
4. There is no strict need to close `stdin` or `stdout` in Python, as they will properly close when the program exits.
5. Command line argument handling (`args`) isn't shown in this minimal translation. If necessary, you would use the `argparse` library or `sys.argv`.
6. Tokenization for input is done using `str.split()` and a simple global list `tok`.
7. I've combined the `in` and `out` assignments into the usage of `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`.
8. The `main` function is replaced by a standard Python `if __name__ == "__main__":` conditional.
9. Python's `print` function is different from Java's `PrintWriter.print`, so we use an f-string for formatted output.
10. Exception handling includes catching any exception and exiting with a non-zero status code after printing the exception details to `stderr`.
11. Python's bitwise operators and control structures (like `if` and `while`) are similar to Java's, so they translate directly.
12. Python uses indentation to denote blocks of code instead of curly braces (`{}`) as in Java.
