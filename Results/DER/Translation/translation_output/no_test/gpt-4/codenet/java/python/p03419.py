Here is the Python translation of the provided Java code:

```python
class p03419:
    def solve(self):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 2 or m == 2:
            print(0)
            return
        ans = max(1, n - 2) * max(1, m - 2)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = p03419()
    p.solve()
```

This Python code defines a class `p03419` which has a method `solve` that receives input for `n` and `m`, and then calculates and prints the answer according to the same logic as in the original Java code. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that `solve` method is called when the script is executed as the main program.
