Below is the translated Java code into Python:

```python
import math
import sys

class InputReader:
    def __init__(self, stream=sys.stdin):
        self.stream = stream

    def read(self):
        return self.stream.read(1)

    def read_int(self):
        num_str = ''
        while True:
            c = self.read()
            if c in '-0123456789':
                num_str += c
            elif c.isspace():
                break
        return int(num_str)

    def read_float(self):
        num_str = ''
        while True:
            c = self.read()
            if c in '-.0123456789':
                num_str += c
            elif c.isspace():
                break
        return float(num_str)


class Solver:
    def solve(self, sc):
        r = sc.read_float()
        pi = math.pi
        print(2 * pi * r)


def main():
    sc = InputReader()
    solver = Solver()
    t = 1
    while t > 0:
        solver.solve(sc)
        t -= 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Notes about the translation:

1. I removed the unused methods and classes in the `InputReader` to keep it simple since the original Java code only uses `nextDouble()` method to read `double` input, which corresponds to `read_float()` in the Python version.

2. I used Python's `print()` function for output instead of creating a `PrintWriter` object like in Java.

3. I simplified reading inputs for integers and floats using `read()`, which reads character by character until non-digit characters or white spaces are detected. 

4. I assumed the Python script is designed to read from `sys.stdin` like the Java program reads from `System.in`.

5. For simplicity, error checking is not as thorough as in the Java version. Python's built-in functions and exception handling would typically be used to handle such cases.

6. The `solve` method now takes only a single argument, which is the `InputReader` object `sc`, since the output is handled by the `print` function directly.

7. Multiplication by PI is done directly using `math.pi`.

Please ensure you handle input and output correctly according to your specific use case, as the above Python implementation assumes a very simplistic and sequential reading of inputs.
