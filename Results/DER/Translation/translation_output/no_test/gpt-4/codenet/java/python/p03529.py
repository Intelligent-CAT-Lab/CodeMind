Here's the translated Python code:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def power_mod(x, exponent):
    prod = 1
    # Note that Python's bitwise shifts automatically convert the result to long type if necessary
    for i in range(63, -1, -1):
        prod = (prod * prod) % MOD
        if (exponent & (1 << i)) != 0:
            prod = (prod * x) % MOD
    return prod

def f(n, k):
    t = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        t += (t + i) // i
    return t

def main():
    n = int(input())
    k = int(input())
    l = f(n, k)
    dp = [[0] * (l + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        m = power_mod(k + 1, i - 1)
        for u in range(l + 1):
            t = 0
            for j in range(min(i, k)+1):
                if u + (u + j) // i <= l:
                    t += dp[i - 1][u + (u + j) // i]
                    t += ((u + j) % i) * m % MOD
                    t %= MOD
            for j in range(min(i, k) + 1, k + 1):
                t = (t + dp[i - 1][u] + (j + u) * m) % MOD
            dp[i][u] = t
    print(dp[n][0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Please note that Python's `//` operator performs floor division, like `/` in Java when applied to integer types. Also, in Java code, there is an error in the method `f`, where the `k` parameter is never used. However, I've preserved it in the translation because it was in the original code. If `f` is supposed to use `k`, you might need to revise the translation.

Remember that Python uses 0-based array indexing, unlike Java which uses 1-based array indexing, so the loops and array accesses need to be adjusted accordingly. The translated Python code also assumes that the inputs are provided line by line, similar to the Java Scanner's `nextInt()` method.
