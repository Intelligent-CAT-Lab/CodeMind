Below is the Python translation of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

# Equivalent function to solve the problem
def solve():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print("Yes" if a + b >= c else "No")

# Function to simulate calling the solve function, similar to the main function in Java
def main():
    solve()

# Equivalent to 'public static void main' in Java
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that Python's built-in functions and simpler I/O mechanisms negate the need for explicit classes for InputStream, OutputStream, Scanner, or PrintWriter equivalents. The `input` function reads a line of input, and `print` outputs to the standard output directly. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line checks if the script is being run as the main program.
