Below is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
def make_memo():
    memo[0] = 1
    memo[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 9):
        for bit in range(2 ** (i - 1)):
            before = 0
            for j in range(i):
                now = (bit >> j) & 1
                if before == 1 and now == 1:
                    break
                before = now
                if j == i - 1:
                    memo[i] += 1


mod = int(1e9) + 7
memo = [0] * 9

make_memo()

H, W, K = map(int, input().split())

dp = [[0] * W for _ in range(H + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 1
for h in range(H):
    for w in range(W):
        # Right
        if w + 1 < W:
            dp[h + 1][w + 1] += dp[h][w] * memo[w] % mod * memo[W - 2 - w] % mod
            dp[h + 1][w + 1] %= mod
        # Left
        if w - 1 >= 0:
            dp[h + 1][w - 1] += dp[h][w] * memo[w - 1] % mod * memo[W - 1 - w] % mod
            dp[h + 1][w - 1] %= mod
        # Down
        dp[h + 1][w] += dp[h][w] * memo[w] % mod * memo[W - 1 - w] % mod
        dp[h + 1][w] %= mod

ans = dp[H][K - 1]
print(ans)
```

Some key notes on the translation:

- We don't need an explicit import for built-in functions like `input` in Python.
- The Python `input` function reads a line from the input as a string. We use `map` along with `int` to convert the string to integers accordingly.
- Python doesn't have static arrays with fixed sizes. We use lists that are initialized with a specific size and with default values (zeros).
- In Java, for bitwise operations, we need to be careful with the priority order. In Python, the bit shift operations are also clear, and we use '2 ** (i - 1)' for the range in the bitwise loop.
- Python uses indentation instead of braces to define blocks of code.

The rest of the operations and logic flow should maintain the original algorithm's essence.
