Here's the translation of the given Java code to Python:

```python
# Read an integer input from the user
n = int(input())

# Output based on the condition
if n == 0:
    print("1")
else:
    print("0")
``` 

This Python code performs the same function as the provided Java code. It takes a single integer input from the user, and prints "1" if the number is 0 or "0" if the number is not 0.
