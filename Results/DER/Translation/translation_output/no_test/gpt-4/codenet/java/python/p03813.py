Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
def main():
    number = int(input())
    print("ABC" if number < 1200 else "ARC")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python program will read an integer from standard input and print "ABC" if the number is less than 1200, and "ARC" otherwise, just as the Java program does.
