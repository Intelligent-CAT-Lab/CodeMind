Here's the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys
import io

class FastScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stdin = sys.stdin
        self.buffer = self.stdin.buffer
        self.newlines = [10, 13]

    def next(self):
        return self.stdin.readline().strip()

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_long(self):
        return long(self.next())

    def next_float(self):
        return float(self.next())

def main():
    sc = FastScanner()
    N = sc.next_int()
    table = [0] * (N + 1)
    table[0] = 0
    M = 0

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + i
        if table[i] >= N:
            M = i
            break

    s = set(range(1, M + 1))
    s.remove(table[M] - N)

    for a in sorted(s):
        print(a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code uses a `FastScanner` class for input operations similar to the original Java code. However, Python's standard library functions like `sys.stdin` and `readline()` simplify this task significantly, so the `FastScanner` class is considerably less complex than its Java counterpart.

For output, we simply use `print()`. Note that in Python, I/O is buffered by default just like in Java's `PrintWriter`, so the functionality will be similar in terms of performance.

Also, I replaced the implicit use of `HashSet` and `PrintWriter` in Java with Python's `set` and `print()` function, which also handle the uniqueness and printing tasks respectively. The code should be executed with Python 3 since it uses the `print()` function and not the `print` statement from Python 2.
