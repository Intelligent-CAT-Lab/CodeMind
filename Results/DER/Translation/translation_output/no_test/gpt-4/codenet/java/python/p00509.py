Here's the translated Python code enclosed within ```python``` tags as requested:

```python
import math

class P00509:

    def run(self):
        n = int(input())
        c = int(input())
        if c < 0:
            if n == 1:
                print(11)
            else:
                print('9' * (n * 2))
        else:
            a = 10 ** n
            b = a // 10
            a -= 1
            for i in range(a, b - 1, -1):
                if self.check(i, c):
                    return

    def check(self, i, c):
        s = str(i)
        builder = s + str(c) + s[::-1]
        if self.prime(int(builder)):
            print(builder)
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def prime(self, b):
        if b <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(b)) + 1):
            if b % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    P00509().run()
```

Please note that Python does not have an equivalent for a `StringBuilder` as it's not needed; strings are easy to concatenate. Also, it's important to handle the edge case where `b` might be less than or equal to 1 in the `prime` method, which I have added because it is a necessary check which is implicitly covered in the Java version, due to how the loop is structured. Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `System.in`, but reading from the standard input is done using `input()`. The `print` function in Python is used instead of `System.out.println`. The `main` method is replaced by a simple if statement checking if the script is the main program being run.
