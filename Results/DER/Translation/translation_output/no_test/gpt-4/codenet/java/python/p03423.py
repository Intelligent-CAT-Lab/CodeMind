Certainly! Here's how you might translate the provided Java code into Python:

```python
import sys

def main():
    l = sys.stdin.readline()
    answer = int(int(l.split()[0]) // 3)
    print(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python script uses `sys.stdin.readline()` to read a line from standard input, just as `BufferedReader` and `InputStreamReader` are used in Java. It splits the line using `split()`, selects the first token, converts it into an integer, and performs floor division by 3 with the `//` operator, which is similar to `(int)Math.floor()` in Java. Lastly, it prints out the answer. Note that this script assumes that the input follows the same format as expected by the original Java code.
