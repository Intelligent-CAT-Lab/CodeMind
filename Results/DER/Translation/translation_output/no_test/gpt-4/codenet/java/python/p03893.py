Here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = int(input())
    next = 2
    for i in range(x):
        next = (next + 1) * 2
    print(next)
```

This Python code accepts an integer input and computes a value using a similar iterative approach as the original Java program.
