Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
print("ABC" + str(a))
```

In Python, you don't need to import a Scanner or any other special class for basic input and output operations. You can read input from the user using the `input()` function and print output using the `print()` function. Since `input()` returns a string, you need to convert the user input to an integer with `int()`. Printing the concatenated string with the integer is straightforward; however, you need to convert the integer back to a string using `str()`.
