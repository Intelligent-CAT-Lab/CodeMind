```python
# Python code equivalent to the provided Java code

# Main function is not required in Python for this simple task
# Just read the inputs and process them directly

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
count = 0

for i in range(a, b + 1):
    num_str = str(i)
    # Assuming a 5-digit integer based on the Java code
    if len(num_str) == 5 and num_str[0] == num_str[4] and num_str[1] == num_str[3]:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

This Python code snippet takes two numbers as input and counts how many numbers are palindromic in the range `[a, b]` (inclusive), considering only five-digit numbers based on the given Java code.
