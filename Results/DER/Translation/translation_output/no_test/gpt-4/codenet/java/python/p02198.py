Here's the Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
import sys

"""
AIZU ONLINE JUDGE
3123
2020/5/1
"""

class P02198:
    def __init__(self):
        # In Python, we don't need a separate PrintStream for logging or result
        # 'sys.stdin' is used for system input
        pass

    def main(self):
        N, M = map(int, input().split())
        print(f'{N * M}')
        return False

def main():
    instance = P02198()
    return instance.main()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

Explanation:

- The `Scanner` class in Java is replaced with Python's built-in `input()` function and `map()` to read and parse multiple integers from a line.
- The `PrintStream` and `OutputStream` are not needed in the Python implementation, since `print()` directs to the standard output by default. Python's standard output and error streams can be accessed via `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`, respectively, if necessary.
- The `systemin` variable is not required because in Python, `sys.stdin` is automatically used for standard input. If you were handling files or other streams, you'd use Python's `open()` function or other appropriate I/O functions or libraries.
- The entry-point is defined by the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, which is the common pattern in Python scripts.
- `sys.exit()` is called at the end of the main script block, exiting with the return value of `main()`. This is optional because the script will exit with status code 0 by default if no errors occur.
