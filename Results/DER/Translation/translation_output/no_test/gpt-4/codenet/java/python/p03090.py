The Java code you've provided scans inputs from standard input, performs a certain operation based on whether an integer is even or odd, and prints the outcomes. Here is how you could translate that code into Python:

```python
import sys

def solve(a, l):
    if a % 2 == 0:
        for i in range(1, a // 2 + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, a // 2 + 1):
                l.append(f"{i} {j}")
                l.append(f"{i} {a + 1 - j}")
                l.append(f"{a + 1 - i} {j}")
                l.append(f"{a + 1 - i} {a + 1 - j}")
    else:
        solve(a - 1, l)
        for i in range(1, a):
            l.append(f"{a} {i}")

def out(num_list):
    for num in num_list:
        print(num)

def out_str(s):
    if dbg:
        print(s)

def ni():
    return int(input())

def ns():
    return input()

def ni_arr(k):
    return [int(input()) for _ in range(k)]

def ns_arr(k):
    return [input() for _ in range(k)]

def ni_matrix(a, b):
    return [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(a)]

# Main execution starts here
dbg = True

def main():
    a = ni()
    l = []
    solve(a, l)
    print(len(l))
    for str_ in l:
        out_str(str_)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script will work similarly to the Java version. Notably, Python handles standard input in a way that might be simpler than Java's Scanner class.

You'll notice a few changes:

1. Python has no explicit 'static' declaration for methods or attributes.
2. I've removed the properties import and use since there's no direct counterpart in this context and itâ€™s not actually used in the provided code.
3. I've translated arrays into Python lists and took some liberties in interpreting how you may have wanted to use the `out` overloading.
4. I've wrapped the script entry point into a `main()` function which is a common pattern in Python.
5. Removed the implementations for unused methods like `out` (int/integer array).
6. Removed unnecessary `sc.nextLine()` calls after `sc.nextInt()` since Python's `input()` naturally moves to the next line.
7. Added conditions to mimic the `sysout` print only if debugging is enabled with the `dbg` flag.

Please modify the input and output processes to match your exact runtime environment if this script is not being run as a standalone program interacting with the terminal directly.
