I've translated the given Java code to Python assuming that the input will be read from the standard input (`sys.stdin`). The Python code maintains the same logic and algorithm used in the Java code. The recursive function `dfs` and other calculations are maintained with appropriate Python syntax and idioms.  However, the Python translation is much more concise due to the higher-level nature of Python as a language, and the absence of boilerplate code dealing with low-level input/output handling often found in Java. 

Please remember that when running this code, it's expecting an integer input, and the `INPUT_STRING` in the above code can be replaced with a string representing the input that would otherwise be entered manually during runtime.
