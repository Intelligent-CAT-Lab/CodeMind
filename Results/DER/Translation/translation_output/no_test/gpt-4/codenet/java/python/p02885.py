Here is the Java code translated into Python, enclosed as you requested:

```python
# no need to import anything for basic functionality in Python

def p02885():
    line = input()  # reading input from the user
    line1 = line.split(" ")  # splitting the input string into a list
    a = int(line1[0])  # converting the first element to an integer
    b = int(line1[1])  # converting the second element to an integer
    if a > 2 * b:
        print(a - 2 * b)  # printing the result of the calculation
    else:
        print(0)  # printing 0 if the condition is not met

# Assuming you want to execute the function when running the script
if __name__ == '__main__':
    p02885()
```

Python does not require a class structure for simple scripts like this one. The `Scanner` class from Java is not needed either, as Python's built-in `input()` function handles user input. Additionally, type conversion in Python uses built-in functions like `int()`. The conditional statement and arithmetic operations are similar in both languages.
