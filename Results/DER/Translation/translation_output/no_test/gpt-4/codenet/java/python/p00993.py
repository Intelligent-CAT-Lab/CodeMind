Here's the Java code translated into Python, using the built-in `math` and `sys` libraries:

```python
from math import factorial
import sys

# Calculate factorial of 1510 (fact に 1510 の階乗を代入)
fact = factorial(1510)

# Loop over each line of input until there's no more input
for line in sys.stdin:
    n = int(line.strip())   # Convert input line to integer n
    print(fact + 2)         # Output fact + 2

    # Output numbers from 2 to (fact + 2 + n - 1)
    for i in range(2, 2 + n):
        print(i)
```

This code works assuming that your Python environment is prepared to handle very large integers, which Python can do natively. The `sys.stdin` is used to read input in a similar way to the Java Scanner and the code assumes that the input will be provided in the same way the Java code expects.

Keep in mind that environments may handle input differently, and in some cases, you might want to use `input()` instead of `sys.stdin` for reading user inputs. However, `input()` reads a single line, so if you are reading multiple lines, you might want to use a loop or another method to capture all the inputs.
