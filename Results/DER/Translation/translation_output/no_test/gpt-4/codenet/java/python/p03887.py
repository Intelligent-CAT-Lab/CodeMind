Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys
from math import comb
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def solve(n, a, b, c):
    if b % 2 == 1:
        return 0

    answer = 0
    for x in range(a, -1, -1):
        group1 = x
        restA = a - x
        group2 = restA
        restC1 = c - restA
        if restC1 < 0:
            break

        if b > 0:
            for y in range(restC1 // 3 + 1):
                group3 = y
                restC2 = restC1 - 3 * y
                group4 = b // 2

                count = comb(b // 2 + restC2 - 1, b // 2 - 1)
                count *= comb(group1 + group2 + group3 + group4, group4)
                count *= comb(group1 + group2 + group3, group3)
                count *= comb(group1 + group2, group2)
                answer = (answer + count) % MOD
        elif restC1 % 3 == 0:
            group3 = restC1 // 3
            count = comb(group1 + group2 + group3, group3)
            count *= comb(group1 + group2, group2)
            answer = (answer + count) % MOD

    return answer

def read_input():
    return map(int, input().split())

def main():
    n, a, b, c = read_input()
    print(solve(n, a, b, c))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python code assumes that Python version is 3.8 or higher because it uses the `math.comb` function to calculate combinations. The `solve` function implements the described algorithm, and the `main` function reads the input in the same way that the `ContestReader` class did and prints out the result. Please note that due to differences in Java and Python, especially in how they handle big integer arithmetic and modular arithmetic, there might be subtle differences in behavior with extremely large numbers. However, Python generally automatically handles large integers without a fixed size constraint.
