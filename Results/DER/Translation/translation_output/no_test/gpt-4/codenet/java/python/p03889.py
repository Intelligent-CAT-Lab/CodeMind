Here's the translated code in Python:

```python
s = input()
arr = list(s)

for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] == 'b':
        arr[i] = 'd'
    elif arr[i] == 'd':
        arr[i] = 'b'
    elif arr[i] == 'p':
        arr[i] = 'q'
    elif arr[i] == 'q':
        arr[i] = 'p'

arr_reversed = ''.join(arr)[::-1]

if s == arr_reversed:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This Python code snippet follows the same logic as the original Java code and performs the specified character swaps before checking if the string is equal to its reversed version after the transformations.
