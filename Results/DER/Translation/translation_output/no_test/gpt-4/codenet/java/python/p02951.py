Here's the translated code in Python:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if b + c < a:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(b + c - a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The Java code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, and then it prints `0` if the sum of `b` and `c` is less than `a`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `b + c - a`. The Python code I have provided does the same using Python's built-in `input()` function to read the numbers and `print()` function to output the result.
