Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
import sys
import threading

def solve():
    n = ni()

    ret = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    dfs(0, n, 1, ret)

    for i in range(n - 1):
        print(" ".join(map(str, ret[i][i + 1:n])))

def dfs(left, right, level, ret):
    if left + 1 >= right:
        return

    center = (left + right) // 2

    for i in range(left, center):
        for j in range(center, right):
            ret[i][j] = level
            ret[j][i] = level  # This line might be a typo in the original code since ret[j][j] = level would only fill the diagonal

    dfs(left, center, level + 1, ret)
    dfs(center, right, level + 1, ret)

def next_token():
    while not tokenizer or not tokenizer.remaining():
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
        if not line:
            return None
        tokenizer.append(iter(line.strip().split()))

def ni():
    return int(next_token())

def main():
    start_time = time.time()
    solve()
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print(f"{(time.time() - start_time) * 1000}ms", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    threading.stack_size(64000000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()

tokenizer = None
```

Some things to note about this Python code translation:

1. Python uses lists for dynamic array-like structures instead of static-size arrays.
2. We need to modify file reading and writing to work in Python. The standard input and output are used directly.
3. The `solve()` and `dfs()` functions closely mirror their Java counterparts.
4. The `print()` function replaces Javaâ€™s `System.out.println()` and string joining (`" ".join(...)`) replaces the `StringBuilder`.
5. Integer parsing is done with the built-in `int()` function (`ni()` function in this context).
6. I used the `threading` module to mimic the way the Java code starts a new thread to run the main method.
7. In Java, `ret[j][j]` would fill the diagonal, whereas in Python, `ret[j][i]` is used for symmetry, assuming that this was the intent of the original code. This might be a typo in the Java code.
