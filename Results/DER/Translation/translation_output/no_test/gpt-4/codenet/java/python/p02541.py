Here's the translated Java code into Python:

Please note that there are several changes applied:

1. The `main` function with the threaded execution pattern in Java is replaced with a direct invocation of the `solve()` function in Python. Python uses a different threading model, and in this translation, it is not necessary to replicate this behavior.

2. The `enumDivisors` functionality in Java was creating a `[]` first and then filling it up backwards. In Python, it's done by first creating lists for each divisor level and then merging them using list comprehensions and concatenation.

3. There is a `maxsize` parameter in Java's `Thread` which is not used in Python.

Please verify the functionality and edge cases, as this translation assumes that the rest of the Java functionality was correct. In a real-world setting, you might need to adjust usage and behavior (especially threading and I/O handling) according to Python standards.
