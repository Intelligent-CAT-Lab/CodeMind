Here's the equivalent code in Python using the built-in capabilities for reading from standard input and handling strings:

```python
# No imports are necessary for this task in Python

# Read a line from standard input
line = input()

# Split the line into tokens (integers), map each token to int, and create a list
sides = list(map(int, line.split()))

# Calculate the total of all the sides (not used in the logic, this can be removed)
total = sum(sides)

# Sort the sides
sides.sort()

# Check if the rectangle condition is met and print the result
if sides[0] == sides[1] and sides[2] == sides[3]:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
```

This code assumes that the input is given as a single line of integers separated by spaces, just like the original Java code expects from `BufferedReader`. Python's `input()` function reads a line from standard input, and `line.split()` breaks it into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each string to an integer. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total of the sides, although it's not needed for the logic to determine if the entered sides form a rectangle. The sides are then sorted using `sort()`, and a conditional statement is used to print "yes" if it is a rectangle, and "no" otherwise.
