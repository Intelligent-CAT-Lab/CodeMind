Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

class FastScanner:
    def __init__(self, stream):
        self.reader = (line for line in stream)
        self.tokenizer = None

    def next(self):
        while self.tokenizer is None or not self.tokenizer:
            self.tokenizer = next(self.reader).split()
        return self.tokenizer.pop(0)

    def next_line(self):
        if self.tokenizer is None or not self.tokenizer:
            return next(self.reader)
        return " ".join(self.tokenizer)

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())  # Assuming we want to return an int in Python as well, for consistency.

def main():
    sc = FastScanner(sys.stdin)
    out = sys.stdout
    input_value = sc.next_int()
    ans = 1
    while input_value >= ans * 2:
        ans *= 2
    out.write(f"{ans}\n")
    out.flush()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here's what changed from the Java code to the Python translation:
- Python doesn’t have a separate `PrintWriter` class. I used `sys.stdout` which can be written to directly with `write()`.
- The Python `FastScanner` class reads lines from the given input stream, which is compatible with iterators and generators.
- In the `next()` method, the string tokenizer is replaced with a list of tokens obtained by splitting the line. We pop tokens from this list one by one.
- In the `next_line()` method, if there are any remaining tokens, they are joined together to form the line.
- I used Python’s built-in `int()` function for parsing integers instead of the `Integer.parseInt()` method in Java.
- The loop and calculation of `ans` work the same way in Python as in Java.
- Since the purpose is not specified for the `next_long()` method, I assumed it should return an integer, as Python's `int` type is unbounded and can handle long integers as well. If you need a true `long`, you could use `int(self.next())` since Python3's `int` is like Java's `long`.
