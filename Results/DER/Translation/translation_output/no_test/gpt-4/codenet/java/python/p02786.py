Below is a Python version of the given Java code snippet:

```python
import sys
import math

class FastReader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reader = sys.stdin
        self.st = None
    
    def next_line(self):
        try:
            return next(self.reader)
        except StopIteration:
            return None
    
    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())
    
    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())  # Python's int type can handle long values
    
    def next_double(self):
        return float(self.next())
    
    def next(self):
        while self.st is None or len(self.st) == 0:
            line = self.next_line()
            if line:
                self.st = line.split()
            else:
                return None
        return self.st.pop(0)


def main():
    reader = FastReader()
    sum_value = 0
    h = reader.next_long()
    if h == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        count = 1
        while h > 1:
            h = h // 2
            sum_value += int(math.pow(2, count))
            count += 1
        print(sum_value + 1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Some differences between the Java and Python code are:

- The BufferedReader is replaced with Python's `stdin` (from `sys` module), and Java's `StringTokenizer` is replaced with a simple list that serves as a token store in this context.
- Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `long` type; instead, Python's `int` type automatically handles large integers.
- The method names have been changed to follow Python's naming convention (snake_case instead of camelCase).
- The `main` function encapsulates the program entry logic, similar to the `public static void main` method in Java. In Python, it's common to use a `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to make sure the script acts as an executable when it is run, but it doesn't execute when imported as a module.
- In Python, we use the double slash `//` operator for integer division to ensure we get an integer result as required by the logic of the original Java program.
- For exception handling related to input, the above code assumes a correct, uninterrupted input as per the original Java code and does not incorporate exception handling.

Make sure to run this Python code in an environment where `sys.stdin` is available and provides the necessary input that the program expects.
