Here's the Java code provided, translated into Python:

```python
# no need to import anything for IO in python

# Equivalent class to AC_GC_22_B in Java
class AC_GC_22_B:
    def solve(self, testNumber, n):
        if n == 3:
            print("2 5 63")
            return
        elif n == 4:
            print("2 5 20 63")
            return

        ans = []
        _2 = 0
        _3 = 0
        _23 = 0
        i = 2
        while len(ans) < n - 2:
            num = i
            if num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0:
                _23 += 1
            elif num % 2 == 0:
                _2 += num
            elif num % 3 == 0:
                _3 += num

            if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
                ans.append(num)
            i += 1

        k = i
        sn = -1
        while True:
            num = i
            if num % 2 == 0 and (_2 % 3 == 0 or num % 3 != 0) and (_2 + num) % 3 == 0:
                sn = num
                ans.append(num)
                break
            i += 1

        i = k
        while True:
            num = i
            if num % 3 == 0 and (_3 % 2 == 0 or num % 2 != 0) and num != sn and (_3 + num) % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(num)
                break
            i += 1

        for num in ans:
            print(num, end=' ')
        print()

def main():
    n = int(input())
    solver = AC_GC_22_B()
    solver.solve(1, n)

# call the main function to start the execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note the following changes and Python-specific adaptations:
1. In Python, there's no need to explicitly import IO-related libraries as these capabilities are built into the language.
2. `print` is used for output in Python instead of the `OutputWriter` class from Java.
3. The Python version reads input directly using `input()`, which automatically reads from `stdin`.
4. The `InputReader` and `OutputWriter` classes are not necessary in Python due to its simplified IO.
5. The `solve` method now receives `n` directly as an argument for simplicity.

I eliminated the imported and unused java libraries, and comments to convert the code into a Pythonic structure. Remember that Python uses indentation for scoping rather than braces `{}` used in Java, and the syntax for defining classes and methods is different.
