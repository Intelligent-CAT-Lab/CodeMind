Below is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Python 3 code
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    print(n - a - b + c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python code, we define a `main` function that reads four integers from standard input and computes the required expression. We then check if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, call the `main` function. This is analogous to the `public static void main` method in Java, which is the entry point of the program.
