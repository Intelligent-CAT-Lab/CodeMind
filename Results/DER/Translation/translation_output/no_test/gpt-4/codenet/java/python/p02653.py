Here's the translated Python code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache


MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7


def solve(n, a, b):
    a, b = max(a, b), min(a, b)

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def f(i):
        if i <= 0:
            return 1
        result = f(i - 1)
        for t in range(b, i+1):
            result = (result + f(i - t - 1)) % MOD
        return result

    dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(max(a, b))] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0][0], dp[0][0][1] = 1, 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum = [0, 0]
        for j in range(a):
            lend = 1 if j == i - 1 else 0
            sum[0] = (sum[0] + dp[i - 1][j][0] * f(j - 2 + lend)) % MOD
        for j in range(b):
            sum[1] = (sum[1] + dp[i - 1][j][1]) % MOD
        for k in range(1, a):
            dp[i][k][0] = dp[i - 1][k - 1][0] if k > 1 else sum[1]
        for k in range(1, b):
            dp[i][k][1] = dp[i - 1][k - 1][1] if k > 1 else sum[0]

    sum = [0, 0]
    for j in range(a):
        sum[0] = (sum[0] + dp[n][j][0] * f(j - 1)) % MOD
    for j in range(b):
        sum[1] = (sum[1] + dp[n][j][1]) % MOD

    invalid = (sum[0] + sum[1]) % MOD
    total = pow(2, n, MOD)
    valid = (total - invalid) % MOD
    return valid


def main():
    n, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    result = solve(n, a, b)
    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this translation, I've made the following adjustments:

1. Converted the Java class structure and static methods into Python functions.
2. Used the built-in Python `functools.lru_cache` decorator for memoization instead of manually managing cache as in the original Java code.
3. Replaced the custom `Modular` and power operations with Python's built-in modulo operator and `pow` function with modulus argument.
4. Removed the `FastInput` and `FastOutput` classes, as Python's standard IO functions are typically adequate.
5. Removed the `Debug` class as it's not used in an actual running mode and is mainly for debugging purposes in the Java code.
6. `ArrayIndex` was not directly translated, as multidimensional array indexing in Python is managed differently.

Please ensure the input is provided through standard input (`stdin`). If you'd like a different handling of input or output, adjustments to the `main` function should be made.
