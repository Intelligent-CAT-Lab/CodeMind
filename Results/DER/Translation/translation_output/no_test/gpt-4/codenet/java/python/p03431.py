The following is a Python equivalent of the provided Java code, using Python's standard libraries:

```python
import sys
from math import comb

MOD = 998244353

def getFIF(max_n, mod):
    fact, ifact, inv = [1] * max_n, [1] * max_n, [1] * max_n
    for i in range(2, max_n):
        inv[i] = (mod - mod // i) * inv[mod % i] % mod
    for i in range(1, max_n):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod
        ifact[i] = ifact[i - 1] * inv[i] % mod
    return fact, ifact, inv

def TaskE(n, k):
    ans = 0
    x = getFIF(500010, MOD)
    fact, ifact = x[0], x[1]

    def comb_mod(n, k):
        if k < 0 or k > n:
            return 0
        return fact[n] * ifact[k] % MOD * ifact[n - k] % MOD

    for diff in range(k % 2, k + 1, 2):
        nr = (k + diff) // 2
        nb = k - nr
        if nr < n:
            continue

        if diff == 0:
            ans += comb_mod(k - 1, nr)
            if ans >= MOD:
                ans -= MOD
            ans -= comb_mod(k - 1, nb - 1 - (nr - n + 1))
            if ans < 0:
                ans += MOD
            continue

        r2 = (k - diff) // 2 - min(k - diff, nr - n) - 1
        b2 = k - r2

        ans += comb_mod(nr + nb, nb) - comb_mod(r2 + b2, r2)
        ans %= MOD
        if ans < 0:
            ans += MOD

    return ans

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(TaskE(n, k))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Do note that the Java code has quite a complex code structure, which includes an `InputReader` and `OutputWriter` for handling input and output efficiently. In the Python code above, I've replaced these with simple Python I/O, as these optimizations are often not necessary. Python's standard library function `math.comb` is used for calculating n choose k, but since it does not handle modular arithmetic, I have provided a `comb_mod` function as per the original implementation that considers the modulus. 

The rest of the code tries to keep the logic and variable names as close to the Java code as possible for easy comparison, although Python allows for more concise expression of some of the constructs.
