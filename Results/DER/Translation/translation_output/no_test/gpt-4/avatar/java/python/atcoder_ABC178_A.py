Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def atcoder_ABC178_A():
    x = int(input())
    if x == 0:
        print("1")
    else:
        print("0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    atcoder_ABC178_A()
```

When you execute this Python script, it will behave similarly to the original Java program, meaning it will read an integer from standard input and print "1" if the input is 0, or print "0" otherwise.
