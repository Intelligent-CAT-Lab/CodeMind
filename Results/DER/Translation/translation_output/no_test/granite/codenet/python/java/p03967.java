Question:
Translate the following code from python to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s=input()
ret=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    ret+=(i%2)-[0,1][int(s[i]=="p")]
print(ret)
```


Answer:
Here's the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            ret += (i % 2) - (s.charAt(i) == 'p'? 0 : 1);
        }
        System.out.println(ret);
    }
}
```

In this Java code, we first import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package to read input from the user. We then declare a `String` variable `s` to store the input string.

Next, we declare an `int` variable `ret` to store the final result. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string. Inside the loop, we calculate the value to be added to `ret` based on the current character and its index.

Finally, we print the value of `ret` to the console.<|endoftext|>
