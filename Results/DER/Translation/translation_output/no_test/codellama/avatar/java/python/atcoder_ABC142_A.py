java Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class atcoder_ABC142_A {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = stdin.nextInt();
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % 2 != 0) {
                sum += 1;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(sum / N);
    }
}

Translate the above java code to python.

python Code:

[/INST]
```python
import sys

N = int(input())
sum = 0

for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        sum += 1

print(sum / N)
```
This is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code. The `Scanner` class in Java is replaced by the `input()` function in Python, which reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. The `nextInt()` method in Java is replaced by the `int()` function in Python, which converts a string to an integer. The `for` loop in Java is replaced by the `range()` function in Python, which generates a sequence of numbers. The `if` statement in Java is replaced by the `if` statement in Python, which is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The `sum` variable in Java is replaced by the `sum` variable in Python, which is used to keep track of the sum of the numbers. The `println()` method in Java is replaced by the `print()` function in Python, which prints a message to the console.</s>
