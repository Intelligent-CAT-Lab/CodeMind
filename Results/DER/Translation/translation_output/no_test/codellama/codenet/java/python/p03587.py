Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```python
import sys

def main():
    input_stream = sys.stdin
    output_stream = sys.stdout
    in = input_stream.readline()
    n = 0
    for c in in:
        if c == '1':
            n += 1
    print(n)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
This is a simple program that reads a string from standard input, counts the number of '1' characters in the string, and prints the result to standard output.

The `input_stream` and `output_stream` variables are used to read and write to the standard input and output streams, respectively. The `in` variable is used to store the input string, and the `n` variable is used to store the number of '1' characters in the string.

The `for` loop iterates over the characters in the input string, and the `if` statement checks if each character is equal to '1'. If it is, the `n` variable is incremented.

Finally, the `print` function is used to print the result to standard output.

Note that this program assumes that the input string is a single line of text. If the input string contains multiple lines, you will need to modify the program to handle that case.</s>
