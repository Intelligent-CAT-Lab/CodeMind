python code:

N = int(input())
print(-(-N//2)/N)

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(-(-N/2)/N);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method to read an integer value. The `println()` method is used to print the result to the console.

Note that the Python code uses the `//` operator to perform integer division, which returns the integer part of the result. In Java, you can use the `/` operator to perform floating-point division, which returns a floating-point number. To get the integer part of the result, you can use the `Math.floor()` method.</s>
