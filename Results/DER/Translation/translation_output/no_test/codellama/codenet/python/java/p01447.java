python code:

n = int(input())

ans = 0
tmp = 1
while n > tmp:
    tmp *= 3
    ans+=1
print(ans)


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        int tmp = 1;
        while (n > tmp) {
            tmp *= 3;
            ans++;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
