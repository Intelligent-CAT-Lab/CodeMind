python code:

n = int(input())
for i in range(n+1):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
      x = i^j
      ct = 0
      while (x>0):
        x //= 2
        ct += 1
      print(ct,end=" ")
    print("")


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int x = i ^ j;
                int ct = 0;
                while (x > 0) {
                    x /= 2;
                    ct++;
                }
                System.out.print(ct + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `^` operator in Python is equivalent to the `Math.pow()` method in Java, which raises the first argument to the power of the second argument. In this case, `i ^ j` is equivalent to `Math.pow(i, j)`.

Also, the `range()` function in Python is not directly equivalent to a Java method, but it can be implemented using a for loop. In this case, the equivalent of `range(n+1)` in Python is `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)` in Java.</s>
