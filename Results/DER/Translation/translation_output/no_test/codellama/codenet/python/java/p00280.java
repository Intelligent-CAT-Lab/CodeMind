python code:

def dfs(game):
    a,b = game.count("A"),game.count("B")
    if  (a == 5 and b < 4 or a < 4 and b == 5 or a == b == 5 or 
            a == 6 and b == 4 or a == 4 and b == 6):
        possible.add(game)
    elif (max(a,b) <= 4 or a == b == 4 or a == 5 and b == 4 or a == 4 and b == 5):
        possible.add(game)
        if game+"A" not in possible: dfs(game+"A")
        if game+"B" not in possible: dfs(game+"B")
            
j,y = map(int,raw_input().split())
possible = set([])
dfs("")
ans = []
for game in possible:
    if (game.count("A"),game.count("B")) == (j,y): ans.append(game)
print  "\n".join(sorted(ans))

Translate the above python code to java.

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class DFS {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int j = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        Set<String> possible = new HashSet<>();
        dfs("", possible);
        String[] ans = new String[possible.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for (String game : possible) {
            if (game.split("A").length == j && game.split("B").length == y) {
                ans[i++] = game;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(String.join("\n", ans));
    }

    private static void dfs(String game, Set<String> possible) {
        int a = game.split("A").length;
        int b = game.split("B").length;
        if (a == 5 && b < 4 || a < 4 && b == 5 || a == b == 5 || a == 6 && b == 4 || a == 4 && b == 6) {
            possible.add(game);
        } else if (Math.max(a, b) <= 4 || a == b == 4 || a == 5 && b == 4 || a == 4 && b == 5) {
            possible.add(game);
            if (!game.contains("A")) {
                dfs(game + "A", possible);
            }
            if (!game.contains("B")) {
                dfs(game + "B", possible);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `split` method in Java is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter. In this case, we are using it to split the `game` string into an array of substrings based on the characters "A" and "B". The `length` method is used to get the length of the array.

Also, the `Math.max` method is used to get the maximum value of two numbers.

The `HashSet` class is used to create a set of strings, which is a collection of unique strings. The `add` method is used to add a string to the set, and the `contains` method is used to check if a string is already in the set.

The `String.join` method is used to join an array of strings into a single string, with a separator between each string. In this case, we are using it to join the `ans` array of strings into a single string, with a newline character between each string.

The `System.out.println` method is used to print the final result to the console.</s>
