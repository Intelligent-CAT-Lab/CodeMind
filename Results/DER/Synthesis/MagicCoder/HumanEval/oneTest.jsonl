The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the iterable and returns a value that will be used for sorting.\n\nIn this case, the `key` function is a lambda function that takes an integer `x` and returns a tuple `(bin(x).count('1'), x)`. The `bin(x).count('1')` part of the tuple is the number of ones in the binary representation of `x`, and the `x` part is the original value of `x`.\n\nSo, when `sorted` is called with this `key` function, it sorts the array first by the number of ones in the binary representation of each number, and then by the original value of each number.\n\nThis solution satisfies the assertion:\n\n```python\nassert sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) == [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n```<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>", "model_name": "MagicCoder", "dataset_name": "HumanEval", "nl": "\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to\n    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.\n    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\n    It must be implemented like this:\n    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n", "input_data": "sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) ", "expected_output": " [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]", "assertion": "assert sort_array([1,5,2,3,4])  ==  [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]"}
