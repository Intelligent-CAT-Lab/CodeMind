We then move the end pointer to the right and repeat the process until we reach the end of the list.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

We create an array `dp` of the same length as the input list `lst`, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset of `lst[:i+1]` that is divisible. We initialize `dp[0]` to 1, since the largest subset of a single number is always divisible.\r\n\r\nThen, we iterate over the list `lst` from index 1 to n-1, and for each index `i`, we iterate over the list `lst` from index 0 to i-1, and for each index `j`, we check if `lst[i]` is divisible by `lst[j]`. If it is, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, since we can add `lst[i]` to the largest subset of `lst[:j]` to get a larger subset that is divisible by `lst[i]`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset of `lst` that is divisible.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), since we are iterating over the list `lst` twice, and the space complexity is O(n), since we are using an array of size n to store the dynamic programming values.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.", "input_data": "largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ])", "expected_output": "4", "assertion": "assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4"}

We can do this by checking if `n` is divisible by `a`. If it is, then we can set `x` to `n // a` and `y` to `(n - a * x) // b`.

In this case, we set it to 1 to remove only the first occurrence.\r\n- Finally, we use slicing to remove the first and last characters from the resulting string.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\r\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"x\") == \"hello\"\r\nassert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\"\r\n```<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.", "input_data": "remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\")", "expected_output": "\"heo\"", "assertion": "assert remove_Occ(\"hello\",\"l\") == \"heo\""}

It first initializes an empty list `amicable_numbers` to store all the amicable numbers. It then loops through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is equal to the sum of its divisors. If it is, then the number is an amicable number and is added to the `amicable_numbers` list. Finally, the function returns the sum of all the amicable numbers in the list.\r\n\r\nThe `divisors` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all its divisors. It first initializes an empty list `divisors` to store all the divisors. It then loops through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is a divisor of `n`. If it is, then the number is a divisor and is added to the `divisors` list.

To check if `p` is prime, the function uses a for loop that iterates over odd integers from 3 to the square root of `p`. If `p` is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime and the loop breaks. If `p` is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime and `count` is incremented.

We create a 2D array `dp` of size `n x k` to store the number of ways of painting the fence. We initialize the first row and column of `dp` to 1, since there is only one way to paint the first and second posts with the first color.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining cells of `dp`, we can fill them using the following recurrence relation:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that we can either paint the `i`-th post with the same color as the `i-1`-th post, or we can paint it with a different color.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the `i`-th post is adjacent to the `i-1`-th post, then we can also paint it with the same color as the `i-2`-th post. Therefore, we add `dp[i-2][j]` to `dp[i][j]` if `j > 0`. Similarly, if the `i`-th post is adjacent to the `i-1`-th post, then we can also paint it with the same color as the `i-2`-th post", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.", "input_data": "count_no_of_ways(2, 4)", "expected_output": "16", "assertion": "assert count_no_of_ways(2, 4) == 16"}

The function uses the comb sort algorithm to sort the list.\r\n\r\nThe comb sort algorithm is a variation of the bubble sort algorithm. The main difference is that the comb sort algorithm uses a gap sequence to reduce the number of comparisons required. The gap sequence is defined as a sequence of integers where each integer is a multiple of a shrink factor. The shrink factor is initially set to 1.3, but can be adjusted to achieve better performance.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm starts by initializing the gap and shrink factors, and then iterating through the list. In each iteration, the gap is divided by the shrink factor to get the next gap. If the gap is greater than 1, the gap is set to 1 and the sorted flag is set to False. If the gap is 1, the sorted flag is set to True.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm then iterates through the list using the gap sequence. In each iteration, if the current element is greater than the next element, the two elements are swapped and the sorted flag is set to False. If the gap is greater than 1, the algorithm moves to the next gap. If the gap is 1, the algorithm moves to the next element.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm continues iterating until the sorted flag is True, indicating that the list is sorted.\r\n\r\nThe function returns the sorted list.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to sort a list of elements.", "input_data": "comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79])", "expected_output": "[5, 15, 25, 37, 79]", "assertion": "assert comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79]) == [5, 15, 25, 37, 79]"}

If the square of the middle element is less than `n`, then we update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the search range. If the square of the middle element is greater than `n`, then we update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the search range.

Finally, it returns the `sum` variable.\r\n\r\nThe function `binomial` takes in two positive integers `n` and `k` and returns the binomial coefficient of `n` choose `k`. It uses recursion to calculate the binomial coefficient. If `k` is 0 or `k` is `n`, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the binomial coefficients of `n-1` choose `k-1` and `n-1` choose `k`.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.", "input_data": "even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4)", "expected_output": "8", "assertion": "assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8"}

It is defined as the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets, where k ranges from 1 to n. The Bell number is denoted by B(n).\r\n\r\nThe Bell number can be computed recursively as follows:\r\n\r\nB(n) = sum(B(i-1) for i in range(1, n+1))\r\n\r\nThe base case is B(0) = 1, since there is only one way to partition an empty set.\r\n\r\nThe above formula can be implemented using recursion as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef bell_number(n):\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return sum(map(lambda x: bell_number(x-1), range(n)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an integer n as input and returns the Bell number B(n). It first checks if n is 0, in which case it returns 1 (the base case). Otherwise, it computes the sum of the Bell numbers B(i-1) for i in range(1, n+1) using the `map` function and the `sum` function.\r\n\r\nThe `map` function applies the `bell_number` function to each element of the range(n), and the `sum` function adds up the results.\r\n\r\nThe output of the function is the Bell number B(2), which is 2.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.", "input_data": "bell_number(2)", "expected_output": "2", "assertion": "assert bell_number(2)==2"}

It then returns the maximum depth of the values.\r\n\r\nThe `max` function is used to find the maximum depth of the values. The `for` loop iterates over each value in the dictionary, and the `dict_depth` function is called on each value. The maximum depth of the values is then found using the `max` function.\r\n\r\nThe final result is the depth of the dictionary, which is 1 plus the maximum depth of the values.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.", "input_data": "dict_depth({'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})", "expected_output": "4", "assertion": "assert dict_depth({'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})==4"}

For any other value of `n`, we recursively call the function with `n-1` and `n-2` as inputs, and add the results together to get the `n`th Lucas number.\r\n\r\nThe assertion `assert find_lucas(9) == 76` checks that the function returns the correct value for the `n`th Lucas number.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.", "input_data": "find_lucas(9)", "expected_output": "76", "assertion": "assert find_lucas(9) == 76"}

We also initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of rotations.\r\n\r\nWe then enter a while loop that continues as long as the left pointer is less than the right pointer. Inside the loop, we calculate the midpoint of the array using integer division.\r\n\r\nIf the value at the midpoint is greater than the value at the right pointer, then the array is sorted in descending order and we update the left pointer to mid+1. This means that the right half of the array is sorted and we need to search the left half for the rotation point.\r\n\r\nIf the value at the midpoint is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, then the array is sorted in ascending order and we update the right pointer to mid. This means that the left half of the array is sorted and we need to search the right half for the rotation point.\r\n\r\nWe then increment the count variable by the difference between the length of the array and the left pointer. This is because the left pointer now points to the rotation point, which is the first element of the right half of the array.\r\n\r\nFinally, we return the count variable, which represents the number of rotations required to generate a sorted array.\r\n\r\nTo test the function, we can call it with the input [3,2,1] and assert that the output is 1.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a python function to count the number of rotations required to generate a sorted array. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-rotations-required-to-generate-a-sorted-array/", "input_data": "count_rotation([3,2,1])", "expected_output": "1", "assertion": "assert count_rotation([3,2,1]) == 1"}

We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. We then loop until the pointers meet or cross each other.\r\n\r\nInside the loop, we check if the left pointer points to an even number. If it does, we move it to the right by incrementing `left`. If the right pointer points to an odd number, we move it to the left by decrementing `right`. If both pointers point to odd numbers, the element must be in the middle of the array. We return the element at the index `left+1` because the array is sorted and the element that appears only once must be the next element after the first occurrence of the element at index `left`.\r\n\r\nIf the loop completes without finding the element, we return `None`.<|endoftext|>", "model_name": "WizardCoder", "dataset_name": "MBPP", "nl": "Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.", "input_data": "search([1,1,2,2,3])", "expected_output": "3", "assertion": "assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3"}
