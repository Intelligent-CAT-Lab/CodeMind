I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
    
[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
def reverse_vowels(str1):
	vowels = ""
	for char in str1:
		if char in "aeiouAEIOU":
			vowels += char
	result_string = ""
	for char in str1:
		if char in "aeiouAEIOU":
			result_string += vowels[-1]
			vowels = vowels[:-1]
		else:
			result_string += char
	return result_string

[Question]
What would be the return value of `reverse_vowels("Python")`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function reverse_vowels takes a string as input.
It first initializes an empty string vowels.
Then it iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it adds it to the vowels string.
After that, it initializes an empty string result_string.
Then it iterates over each character in the input string again. If the character is a vowel, it adds the last vowel from the vowels string to the result_string and removes the last vowel from the vowels string. If the character is not a vowel, it adds the character to the result_string.
Finally, it returns the result_string.
<<<Output>>>
